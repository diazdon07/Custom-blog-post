<p>Catherine McKnight, lovingly known as “Granny”, was Justin’s grandmother and the matriarch of the Wynn family.  She was a beloved teacher in Evanston School District 65 for more than 30 years and an unwavering supporter of the Justin Wynn Fund.  The Justin Wynn Fund Board of Directors created the Catherine McKnight Scholarship in 2019 to honor both her memory and her passion for education and community service.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On a hot and humid September day, 115 soccer players from 1<sup>st</sup> through 8<sup>th</sup> grade came together to play in the annual Justin Wynn SoccerFest at ETHS Lazier Field.  The day was a true celebration of community and soccer as players affiliated with area organizations like AYSO, JaHbat, Team Evanston, Chicago Fire Juniors North Shore, plus players not affiliated with any organization participated in the tournament.</p>
<p>Each year a portion of the funds raised at SoccerFest are donated to a local organization chosen by the youth in the Justin Wynn leadership program.  This year’s recipient is Books and Breakfast, a before school program offering a healthy morning meal and homework help to Evanston elementary students in need of additional support.</p>
