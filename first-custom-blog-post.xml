You may have other, more tax efficient resources at retirement than you realize. &nbsp;</p> <p>Tax code gives RAF supporters a really great tool to fulfill their personal hopes for the foundation. If you are 70 1/2, and are required to begin IRA withdrawals – and pay tax on them – consider this special provision. To avoid being hit with taxation on these IRA resources, simply instruct your IRA administrator to make a Qualified Charitable Deduction (QCD) to the RAF. You can donate up to $100,000 per year WITHOUT having to declare the withdrawals as taxable income. This satisfies the requirements of the mandatory age 70 1/2 taxable withdrawals.</p> <p>If you decide to designate the RAF as recipient of a QCD, be sure to let RAF HQ know. Call 406-582-1723 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email contact@theraf.org</a>. You can make a special wish, or support a favorite RAF project.</p> <p>The RAF advises all parties to consult their own tax professionals to address their specific tax concerns or obligations.</p> <p><em>We’ll be sharing other tax tips — watch this space next quarter for other ways to maximize tax advantages while&nbsp;</em><em>optimizing&nbsp;</em><em>your wealth.&nbsp;</em><em>If you have any questions, email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@theraf.org" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">contact@theraf.org</a>.</em></p> <p><em>Submitted August 5, 2025.</em></p> ]]>

Knowing that many RAF folks have dogs, she asked Matt to create RAF-branded collars and leashes to sell in the RAF Outfitter.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matt-Jewett-Mtn-Straps-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18583 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matt-Jewett-Mtn-Straps-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matt-Jewett-Mtn-Straps-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matt-Jewett-Mtn-Straps-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matt-Jewett-Mtn-Straps.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Matt began his business like so many of us, by taking out a loan for his first piece of machinery. He was nine years old, and borrowed thirty-two dollars that went toward a lawnmower. “I paid my dad back within two weeks,” Matt says, establishing his good credit – beginning with the Bank of Dad.</p> </div></div> <p></p> <p>“By the time I left for college I had a partner, two trucks and up to four seasonal employees,” Matt says. After graduation from Montana State University, he went to work for an upstart company named Cannondale which, just a year before, had introduced their first bicycles. “I went into it with a two year game plan, yet stayed for thirty,” he adds.</p> <p>The owner was a passionate pilot who would fly from Cannondale’s home office in Connecticut to their factories in Pennsylvania twice each week. Beginning with a Conquest Turboprop, the commute picked up speed with a Learjet. Matt spent a lot of time in those aircraft, often in the front right seat, discussing business issues in the relatively quiet flight deck.</p> <p>“When I was at Cannondale, all bikes, clothing, and accessories were made in their own factories. I grew to love manufacturing and the challenges it presents. When the opportunity to create Mtn Straps came along, I knew I wanted to control production and not farm it out overseas.”</p> <p>Matt obtained his startup cash by selling a Subaru, and today, Matt and his colleagues manufacture artisan ski pole straps and pet collars and leashes. “We’ve been going seven years now and I’m still finding ways to improve production flows,” he says.</p> <p>“Ski pole straps are still a big part of our business. There are eight million skiers in the US. Our pet business is larger and year-round. The US pet industry is estimated to be 152 billion dollars a year in sales. Needless to say, we have plenty of runway in front of us to keep growing,” he says.</p> <p>Initially, to get their products into consumers’ hands, Mtn Straps displayed at local farmers markets. “While we no longer do farmers markets, but the folks I met in those early years gave us the encouragement to know we were on the right path,” Matt says.</p> <p>Although Covid brought trials, pet stores were considered essential business. Since Mtn Straps controls its own production and sources all its materials in the states, they were able to keep going when others had their products stuck overseas.</p> <p>“I’m still having a ball with Mtn Straps. Many of my friends are retired and shake their heads seeing the time I put in,” he says. Bicycles are still a big part of Matt’s life during his precious off-time. He volunteers with the Southwest Montana Mtn Bike Association. In winter, he says, “Somebody has to test our ski pole straps, so you can find me at Big Sky and Bridger on a regular basis.” Not far from home he can also enjoy fishing, hiking, and backcountry raft or canoe trips each year.</p> <p>What’s next for Mtn Straps, we asked Matt. “This business can continue to scale and grow far beyond where we are today. Dare I say, the sky’s the limit?”</p> <p>See the RAF-branded Mtn Straps products at the <a href="https://outfitter.theraf.org/">RAF Outfitter</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 29, 2025</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

This guest editorial is by Crista Worthy, a pilot, freelance writer, and editor.</em></p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Aviation Inheritance</span></strong>:</p> <p>You, and other pilots who support organizations like the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF), Idaho Aviation Association (IAA), and Montana Pilots Association (MPA) know these organizations are dedicated to preserving recreational airstrips across the U.S. and in their respective states. But who first built them, and why? And why are they still here? Follow my journey of discovery, summarized below, and your understanding and appreciation of these places will grow.</p> <p>Based in Santa Monica, Calif., we’d flown our Robertson-STOL-equipped C-210 to 44 states, but never Idaho or the backcountry until August 2001 when I discovered Galen Hanselman’s book, <em>Fly Idaho! </em>On our first trip, we camped at Wilson Bar and swam in the Salmon River. At Johnson Creek, I watched huge Chinook salmon spawn in the shallows. I wept; those fish had overcome giant dams and fought their way 900 miles inland and a mile above sea level, for this, their final act of survival, to perpetuate their line. And at Fish Lake, we spent the day watching cow moose forage in the lake, calves at their sides. These were among the happiest days of my life.</p> <p>I joined the above organizations, made more trips to Idaho, and, after seeing a spectacular photo of RAF supporter Michael Todd’s silver Skywagon in the Missouri Breaks during a lightning storm, wrote letters in support of the Missouri Breaks airstrips. By the time we moved to Idaho in 2011 I was Managing Editor of <em>Pilot Getaways</em> magazine. I began producing the IAA’s monthly <em>Flyline </em>and became deeply involved with the recreational aviation community.And then Arcadia Publishing asked me to write a book about Idaho’s aviation history.</p> <p>Wow! In the process of gathering historic photos and stories for my book <em>Images of Aviation: Idaho Aviation</em>, I “met” an amazing array of courageous, hard-working, innovative, and often hilarious characters: the men and women who used aviation as a tool to make their living in the wilderness. <em>You see, we use these airstrips for recreation. But they were built for work</em>.</p> <p>In 1910, a terrible drought struck the West. Late that summer over 1,000 fires converged into the “Big Burn,” which scorched 3.25 million acres in just 36 hours, destroying towns, wasting 8 billion board feet of timber, and killing some 85 people. The USFS turned to aviation for help. In 1922, WWI veteran Nick Mamer, an Air National Guard pilot out of Spokane, began flying patrols to report forest fires. 100 years ago this year, he landed at Stonebraker Ranch in Idaho’s Chamberlain Basin to make a deal with William Stonebraker, a hunting outfitter. Mamer flew hunters into the ranch for Stonebraker, and commercial backcountry aviation began.</p> <p>But it didn’t stop there. Mines like the Stibnite in Idaho had to shut down every winter, but once pilots like Mamer and A.A. Bennett figured out how to put skis on airplanes, supplies and people could be ferried in and out year-round. Airstrips were built and new planes like the Zenith, in which Bennett carried everything from mining equipment to a piano and even a cow, were designed.</p> <p>The USFS built some 5,000 fire lookouts in the 1930s, but they also built airstrips so pilots could fly firefighters into the forest. Mamer taught Bob Johnson and Penn Stohr to fly, and soon Johnson Flying Service out of Missoula had a fleet of sturdy aircraft and skilled pilots who flew in lumber, mail, and literally the kitchen sink so homesteaders could build ranches for themselves and visitors. Those primitive airstrips were lifelines. Bill Gowen made the first-ever landing at Cabin Creek in 1931 to rescue a critically-injured man. An old miner, hiding in the trees, watched the Travel Air 6000 take off from the hastily-cleared field and ran to the backcountry phone, exclaiming, “Slim! It’s all over for that plane! It’s gonna crash! The wings weren’t flapping!” He’d never seen an airplane.</p> <p>In 1935, the Zimmerly brothers flew 60,000 pounds of freight, trained 20 students, and carried 3,600 passengers. In the 1950s, Jim Larkin rescued 4 prize horses from Morgan Ranch in the winter. Bob Woods regularly flew horses and ponies into Pistol Creek for the little girls who summered there.</p> <p>This is just a tiny peek into the legacy you have inherited, and that the 1980 Central Idaho Wilderness Act, and subsequently the RAF, IAA, and MPA have preserved.

RAF Michigan/Alaska Ambassador Rob Aho initially applied for the RAF grant, and funds for the project were also provided by the National Forest Foundation, the US Forest Service, and the Washington Seaplane Pilots Association.</p> <p>The work party, led by RAF Alaska Liaison Jeff DeFreest and his wife, Ambassador Kari DeFreest, took place July 14-18 and received support from area volunteers.</p> <p>“The Black Bear Lake cabin project was a success,” Kari DeFreest reported. The five-day work party required significant pre-planning and logistical coordination to get people, tools, food, and materials into the remote location on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest.</p> <p>Due to US Forest Service funding restrictions, the National Forest Foundation covered air charter flights for ferrying heavy supplies, tools, and volunteers to the site. “Misty Fjords Air again provided needed air taxi services to keep the project on track. They are definitely a committed partner on RAF projects,” Kari DeFreest said.</p> <p>Three volunteers and one USFS person were on site for all five days. A total of 11 volunteers, from Alaska, Idaho, and California assisted. “Two local pilots were among the volunteers. They each flew their personal aircraft to the remote site at least three times, ferrying supplies and volunteers,” DeFreest said.</p> <p>The crew replaced the front deck and stairs, removed some rotten subflooring and shored up the front of the cabin. They cleaned and disinfected the interior, replaced a broken window, and caulked the skylight to prevent leaks. They cleaned and repainted the wood stove and installed a new heat shield beneath it. They painted the exterior and installed an RAF fire ring.</p> <p>They repaired the boardwalk leading from the beach to the cabin, built new stairs from the beach, brushed around the cabin, and built a new bridge on the trail to the outhouse.</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" data-id="18696" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-Before.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18696" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-Before.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-Before-300x225.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-Before-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" data-id="18694" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-After.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18694" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-After.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-After-300x225.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cabin-After-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> </figure> <p>Volunteer Tony Trimm reflected on the work, saying, “I appreciated Jeff&#8217;s [DeFreest] contagious enthusiasm for the project. Ingenuity and teamwork go a long way in problem solving.</p> <p>This cabin is now a more desirable facility – one of more than 140 reservable cabins on the Tongass National Forest where visitors can experience Alaska’s water-accessible wilderness.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 31, 2025</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

The airfield and camping facilities are open for public use, but the runway, at 1,500 feet long, was not suitable for a wide range of GA use.</p> <p>To make the facility more accessible for a more diverse array of aircraft, and to be available for community service like firefighting and medical evacuations, it needed to be graded and lengthened.</p> <p>RAF Maine Liaison Andy Rowe was aware of the National Guard’s Innovative Readiness Training program, in which Guard civil engineers obtain real-life experience to prepare them for scenarios&nbsp;where similar skills and work are needed, while providing benefit to community infrastructure, construction, and improvements.</p> <p>Rowe was able to secure the 185th Engineering Support Company of the Maine Army National Guard to undertake grounds preparation through application by the nonprofit RAF. In June of 2025, this round of work was undertaken to lengthen and level the runway. The National Guard engineers brought equipment from their base in Presque Isle and moved and graded 13,500 cubic yards of earth over a 100-ft wide by 1,200-ft long section of the airfield. “Cowboy’s Air Ranch&nbsp; is a wonderful training opportunity for the reservists,” Rowe said. After their work is completed, Winiarski will gather RAF volunteers to help seed and prepare the anticipated 3,000-ft long runway. The RAF will announce its completion, planned for 2026.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trucks.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18533" style="width:560px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trucks.png 400w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trucks-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure></div> <p>“The work facilitated by the RAF to maintain, build, and keep open these remote airfields is so valuable to everyone in aviation,” Winiarski said, as he regarded the work on the turf airfield.</p> <p><em>Submitted on July 18, 2025.</em></p> ]]>

Beginning Monday morning at Daher’s press conference, the RAF awarded Daher CEO Nicolas Chabbert with its prestigious Golden Pulaski for his commitment to the RAF mission. “We were proud to present him with this well-deserved award,” RAF President Bill McGlynn said, adding, ”It’s our way to thank Daher Kodiak and Nicolas, especially, for all their extraordinary support of RAF efforts keeping backcountry airstrips available for recreational access.”</p> <p>RAF’s traditional Tuesday morning Donuts and Coffee on the Hartzell Rooftop was the place to be again. ”We always enjoy seeing old and new friends at this event. We served a lot of coffee and a record number of donuts, and we loved seeing all of the orange shirts flock to the Hartzell building,” RAF Operations Coordinator Kodi Myhre said. “Thank you to Hartzell Propeller for hosting us again this year. We appreciate their friendship and generosity,” RAF Director Steve Taylor said.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:51% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bill-Presenting.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18640 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bill-Presenting.png 400w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bill-Presenting-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Throughout Wednesday, EAA and Redbird&#8217;s &#8220;Backcountry Flying Day” in the Pilot Proficiency Center, the RAF presented several seminars discussing backcountry flying, etiquette, and accessibility.

Cruz and his crew drove 15 miles one-way up the rough and twisting trail hauling compact track loaders and UTVs to the strip. For two days they cleared turnarounds at both ends. They built up the runway crown to ensure proper drainage and graded the runway, leaving a firm, smooth surface well-suited for backcountry aircraft. &#8220;Something needed to be done to restore this amazing airstrip. Thanks to our collaboration with the National Park Service staff and an exceptional RAF supporter, it was,” Goza said.</p> <p>The RAF interest in Nugget Creek began when RAF supporters and local pilots expressed safety concerns. The runway edges were overgrown, and harsh weather and use had caused ruts and washouts. RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton and Goza began meeting with NPS staff to discuss maintenance, and the rehabilitation project gained traction in early 2024.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:67% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Landing-at-Nugget-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18605 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Landing-at-Nugget-1.png 400w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Landing-at-Nugget-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Phase one was led by Christopher Wilcox, Chief of Maintenance for the Wrangell St Elias National Park and included brushing by NPS crews in mid-June. “Phase two was nothing short of exceptional,” Goza said.</p> </div></div> <p></p> <p>“Thanks to Christopher Wilcox and the NPS brush-clearing crew, Dave Cruz and his team – including Lance Williamson, Mike Uher, and Mike Lackey – Nugget Creek remains a shining example of what’s possible when volunteers and land managers work together to preserve our backcountry airstrips. Thank you for ensuring this gateway to adventure remains safe and accessible,” Goza added.</p> <p>To top off the project, on Sunday, July 13, Goza and her husband Randy, RAF Director Jeff Russell, Jim Stevenson, and Joe McDonough, all of Wisconsin; and Christina Young and Gerry Moriarty both of Alaska, flew six airplanes to Nugget Creek to see the completed project and to hang the RAF Supports This Airstrip sign.</p> <p>Nugget Creek cabin lies at about 3,000 ft elevation and is a short walk from the strip. It offers four bunks, a wood stove, and what Goza calls, “jaw-dropping views of Mount Blackburn. From the cabin, adventurers can hike a trail that winds toward the Kuskulana Glacier, explore historic mining ruins, or simply sit on the porch and watch the evening light paint the Wrangell Mountains,” she added.</p> <p>Nugget Creek does not appear on sectionals. Its coordinates are 61°37.28&#8217;N/143°42.59&#8217;W. It will soon be added to the Airfield Guide. It is approximately 18 nm east of Chitina, CXC which is on the Copper River.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 31, 2025</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

This project was supported by RAF Supporter Sherry Sherod who funded this and other airfield kiosks in memory of her husband, bush pilot William Neal Sherod. RAF Supporter and Oregon Ambassador Kevin Johnson volunteered to manage construction and installation.</p> <p>RAF Washington Liaison Ray Ballantyne had coordinated this and a previous RAF-funded off-grid solar shower house project with airfield owners Ryan and Marianne Larrance, who graciously provide the water source. In addition to RAF volunteers Johnson and Jay PerryCook, local EAA Chapter 430 volunteers helped on that project.</p> <p>The 2,759-ft turf airfield is paralleled by an equally long stretch of water for aircraft float operations. Now, in addition to a secluded place to pitch tents close to Olympic National Park, campers can enjoy the shower house and charging kiosk. The 126-mile Olympic Discovery Trail can be accessed down the hill from Olympic Field’s campground. It follows the Old Seattle &amp; North Coast Railroad grade, making it an easy biking, running, or hiking route.</p> <p>Olympic Airfield lies a dozen miles southwest of Washington State’s “rain shadow” town of Sequim, the ideal environment to have earned the title, “Lavender Capital of North America.” Maybe if the breeze is just right, you can drift off to its relaxing essence.</p> <p>For more information and permission contact details, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 30, 2025</em></p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

This guest editorial is by Luke Lachendro, a Wisconsin pilot and an RAF Ambassador.</em></p> <p><strong><u>Preserving More Than Airstrips</u></strong></p> <p>In aviation, we often talk about freedom. The ability to lift off from the ground and chase horizons few others get to see. But for me, the real freedom in aviation comes not just from where we can fly, but from who we meet when we land.</p> <p>As a younger aviator who grew up on a private airstrip in south-central Wisconsin, I’ve been incredibly lucky. Not just to fly over 80 different types of airplanes, but to be surrounded by a tribe of aviators, mentors, and friends who have helped shape my path. That sense of community and shared purpose is at the heart of why I fly, and why I believe so deeply in the mission of the Recreational Aviation Foundation.</p> <p>Backcountry aviation and grassroots flying are full of technical challenges, regulatory work, and physical labor. But what keeps it moving forward is the people. The airstrip owner who hands you a wrench and a story. The couple who opens their hangar and fires up a grill. The mentor who walks you through your first “real” cross-country. These relationships don’t just make flying better, they make it sustainable, meaningful, and worth protecting.</p> <p>I’ve found that my aviation family isn’t about blood, it’s about shared passion. The people I’ve met through aviation have opened doors I never knew existed. Opportunities to fly new aircraft, to grow a business, to take on leadership roles, and to give back. And in return, I try to do the same. That spirit of paying it forward and lifting others as you grow is a thread I see woven into every RAF volunteer I’ve had the pleasure to meet.</p> <p>The RAF understands this better than anyone. Their work isn’t just about preserving airstrips; it’s about preserving access. Not only to places, but also to relationships (very important to focus on this with the next generation of aviators). Every time the RAF protects a backcountry airfield, they’re safeguarding a gathering place. A space where friendships are born over donuts by a windsock, or where a kid gets their first airplane ride that changes the direction of their life.</p> <p>The beauty of RAF-supported airstrips isn’t just in the views or the remoteness. It’s in the connections. They bring us together in ways that’s unexplainable. In a world that often feels disconnected, aviation remains one of the few places where a stranger on the radio becomes a friend by the time you shut down the engine. As a fellow RAF supporter likes to say, “For those who&nbsp;<em>understand,</em>&nbsp;no explanation is necessary. For those who don’t, no explanation is possible.” The RAF is an excellent steward of explaining the necessity of keeping the impossible, possible!</p> <p>I’m still early in my aviation journey, and I know there’s a lot left to learn. But one thing has become clear. You can’t solo your way through aviation. You can’t fake it until you make it. You need the hangar talks, the right-seat rides, the advice that only comes from years of experience, trial, and a few mistakes along the way.</p> <p>To those who have guided me so far, thank you. And to those just starting out: don’t chase the ratings without also chasing the relationships. Because when you need advice, a part, or a place to land, your logbook won’t have the answer. Your friends, mentors, and RAF family will.</p> <p>Supporting the RAF isn’t just about making a donation (please keep doing that though). It’s about joining a culture that believes flying isn’t a solo act, but a shared experience. It’s about saying yes to being part of something meaningful and lasting. Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about where you can land. It’s about who’s there when you do. And if you land at my home airstrip, you want my mom to be there because there’s nothing that beats her dark chocolate chip banana bread after a flight.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:47% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Luke-Lachendro.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14175 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Luke-Lachendro.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Luke-Lachendro-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Luke-Lachendro-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Luke Lachendro is a Wisconsin RAF Ambassador and founder of Aviation Asset Management Group.

RAF Michigan Liaison General Grant says, “Paul is always offering his services and has been incredible about answering calls for help from North Fox Island, 18 nm from Welke’s airport.”</p> </div></div> <p>The RAF helped to reopen North Fox Island in 2015, reclaiming the airfield and adding camping amenities when Brad Frederick was RAF Michigan Liaison. Since then, it has become a very popular recreational location. Brad says, “Paul has helped us out often on North Fox, flying the first mower and other equipment over to the island. He&#8217;s also done some flyovers to check on people, if their loved one was worried. He’d check and confirm that yes, there was a tent there.”</p> <p>Beaver Islanders who live year round – as well as the thousands of tourists who visit this 56 square mile place – also appreciate Welke’s Part 135 operation. Their comfortable, capable Britten Norman Islanders fly 28,000 to 30,000 passengers per year. The 15-minute flight saves waiting to board one of two ferries, then plying the moody waters of Lake Michigan over two hours each way from Charlevoix. Paul says winds can gust 35 or more knots in the region. Lake Michigan is infamous for swallowing ships. In fact, within swimming distance of one of Beaver island’s beaches, there is a 1689 shipwreck considered the “holy grail” of shipwreck hunters.</p> <p>The ferries cease operating from mid-December to mid-April due to ice, but that doesn’t stop Islanders from needing transportation. “A huge part of our business is freight, US mail, Fed Ex, and UPS,&#8221; Paul said. In a medical emergency, Island Air serves as an air ambulance, and within 15 minutes can prepare an Islander aircraft for a stretcher with a patient plus a paramedic and EMT. “We typically do 30-35 medical evacuations a year, getting people off the island. Some evacuations are so urgent we get folks to the hospital within the golden hour,” Paul said.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 14, 2025</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

But none of these five are recognized by the BLM. She was awarded an RAF grant to pay half the cost of the required Cultural Surveys; the other half was generously paid for by an RAF Supporter.

As a recent blog post suggested, not smart is a passive act, remedied with learning, experience, and thought; while stupid is active – the result of someone who should have or could have known better, but decided to do something selfish, impulsive, or dangerous anyway.</p> </div></div> <p></p> <p>As an organization we have concluded it is a good thing to lean in on the idea of safety and etiquette in the world of backcountry flying. Since we are in the middle of our busier summer flying season, this subject might be worth a little space.</p> <p>The RAF has two pretty simple reasons for our attention to the subject.</p> <p>We want to continue to see you out there in the backcountry with friends and fellow aviators enjoying this special way to see the world.<br>We want to make sure we do our best to be good stewards so as to attract more people to what we do, and less who want us to go away.</p> <p>Aviation is unique in that the penalty for being stupid is pretty high. As a friend of mine said, “Airplanes are just not built to crash.” So we need to think about and learn from the not smart things we have done, and not sink to the stupid things we know better than to do.</p> <p>The RAF has assembled a team of folks, both within the RAF as well as friends associated with the RAF to tell the safety and etiquette story as best we can. We surely don’t know it all, and would like to think of our community as best in class when it comes to willingness to learn.</p> <p>With that in mind I am going to ask that you help us out. For sure, we want you to get out in the backcountry. After all, the reason we exist is to protect the ability to access and enjoy these special places. So here is what I would like you to do for me. Please leave a comment on this story with your best or favorite tip that pertains to backcountry safety and or etiquette. I am betting we will learn some things from each of you. If we might already know it, well, it won’t hurt to be reminded.</p> <p>And last but not least, if you see something either not smart or worse yet – stupid…say something. The best way for us to be a better community is to talk to one another. Do your best to be both constructive and positive. No better way to promote safety and etiquette.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you out flying.</p> <p>&#8211; John McKenna, RAF Chairman</p> <p></p> <p><em>Submitted July 15, 2025</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

Last year, RAF volunteers used an RAF grant to install four tent platforms, a park-style barbecue grill, several RAF fire rings, and an informational kiosk. </p> <p>Goodspeed’s 2,120-ft paved runway lies beside the historic Connecticut River. Its 4,500-ft seaplane base has an amphibious ramp and is the only one in southern New England. Bring your fishing gear and toss your line right from this scenic recreational airport. Launch your paddle boards and inflatables and drift in the river. More sophisticated attractions are within walking distance of your tie-downs, like restaurants, shops, and galleries. There’s even an opera house where you can enjoy award-winning live theater.</p> <p>This distinctive airport was in jeopardy of closure when RAF Director Bill Brine learned that the owner had put the airport up for sale. Brine connected local aviation enthusiasts who then motivated a third-party foundation to add their resources. The RAF provided funds toward the down payment, leveraging the local group into an outright purchase, preserving this gem for public use in perpetuity.</p> <p>For more information on Goodspeed, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray<br>Submitted on June 25, 2025.</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Lynn Mareth, an RAF Ambassador and leader of the Backcountry Etiquette Team.</em></p> <p>Spring is in the air here in northwest Montana. The swallows have returned to our place and are making lazy figure eights through the air as they swoop over the river in search of a tasty meal. I just finished a lovely flight in my Super Cub along the jagged snow-capped peaks that border our now lush green valley. As I descended over the Middle Fork of the Flathead River near Hungry Horse, I marveled at the roiling waters of the spring runoff and how they elegantly joined a long thread of emerald green waters at its confluence with the South Fork. It’s a sure sign that spring is here and that summer is on its way.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the summer flying season right around the corner, our RAF Backcountry Etiquette Team has been quietly working in the background on initiatives that promote responsible aviation in the backcountry. Our goal is to help educate and mentor newer pilots and remind seasoned pilots to respect and protect our special places to ensure these airstrips will remain accessible for future generations to enjoy.</p> <p>When I first envisioned promoting backcountry etiquette within the RAF in the fall of 2023, I wasn&#8217;t sure where it would lead, or if it really aligned with the RAF&#8217;s mission. The McKennas suggested that we share the idea with supporters during the next regional educational conferences. The consensus was that the RAF should pursue the initiative as it does align with the RAF’s mission to preserve airstrips. Next, we assembled a diverse team of pilots who are passionate about what we are trying to accomplish. The team has been collaborating on a lot of great ideas that we have started to implement, and I am hopeful that our message is well received.</p> <p>I&#8217;m always in awe of the caliber of people we have supporting the RAF. Many of these volunteers willingly provide all three T&#8217;s of philanthropy: their Time, Talent and Treasure. It is very rare to have so many volunteers like this in an organization as they continue to work tirelessly in support of the RAF&#8217;s mission throughout the year. Sometimes I feel insignificant with what I do in support of the RAF, but I know that even my small contributions are an essential cog in the wheel that keeps us moving forward like the annual cycle of the changing seasons.&nbsp;</p> <p>Aristotle once said, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” which makes me believe that it is the combined interaction of our RAF family that makes this organization so special, and one that I&#8217;m truly grateful to be a part of.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="769" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-769x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18253 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-768x1022.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-1154x1536.jpg 1154w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-1538x2048.jpg 1538w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20230312_202442670-scaled.jpg 1923w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Lynn has her private pilot rating with ASEL, ASES, instrument rating, high performance, complex, and tailwheel endorsements.

Russell reports that this annual spring work party was a great success in spite of challenging weather. “Regular Lakewood volunteers, Jeff and Patty Plantz and Ted Davis flew in on Wednesday ahead of the high winds. They were the only two planes at the event. But the weather didn&#8217;t deter other&nbsp;RAF volunteers from showing up on four wheels,” Russell said.</p> <p>Over four days&nbsp;they completed a long list of projects suggested by hosts Bob and Judy Gillette. The group installed a new water heater in the hangar, converted light fixtures to LED, felled and bucked dead trees for firewood, mowed the runway and property, filled potholes and the waterline trench, removed stumps and did other brushing and clean up tasks. Judy’s special tipi was erected for the season, and RAF Supporters John and Vicky Van Eendenburg from Bloomington, MN stayed in it Saturday night.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="750" height="1000" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakewood-Lodge-Teepee.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18285" style="width:494px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakewood-Lodge-Teepee.jpg 750w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Lakewood-Lodge-Teepee-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure></div> <p>“The John Deere tractor donated by&nbsp;former RAF Director&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Burwell&nbsp;was in constant use all weekend. It was absolutely invaluable, as was the Polaris side-by-side,” Russell said.</p> <p>The RAF sends a huge thanks to all the RAF volunteers who helped. “A special thanks goes to Bob and Judy&#8217;s nephew, Max Peterson and his friends, Aiden and Ferdy, who cooked for us all weekend long. The food was absolutely fantastic,” Russell added.

Due to limited Forest Service resources, the cabin had fallen victim to deferred maintenance.</p> <p>This grant will enable another cooperative project with the USFS. “This is an opportunity for the RAF to further develop our partnership with the USFS, following the successful work completed at Heckman Lake,” Aho said. “The resounding success from that partnership will continue and will hopefully lead to future projects,” he added.&nbsp;</p> <p>USFS Cabin and Trail Manager Devan Collier will oversee the work, and RAF volunteers will remain on site throughout the multi-day project, some in tents, accessible by skiff from the cabin. Cooking facilities are very limited, and Kari DeFreest is managing provisioning and preparation of crew meals in this extremely remote location where all supplies must be flown in.&nbsp;</p> <p>Crews will repair the front porch, outhouse, chimney system, entryway and rear window. They will brush out around the cabin and stairs, install an RAF fire ring and&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire extinguisher. If time permits, they will reconstruct trails using lakeshore on-site gravel and repurposed lumber from demolition work, and repair the existing skiff haul out winch.</p> <p>For more information on Black Bear see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p>Submitted on May 23, 2025.</p> ]]>

Substitute “Passion” for “Ambition,” and you’ve pretty well summed up the RAF.</p> <p>Everything at the RAF starts with building a relationship. That relationship can be with another person, another organization, or even a place. And that can take persistence. You don’t have to dig too deeply to find examples of these kinds of relationships that make for the foundation of RAF success. Thanks to the relationships you’ve built, the RAF is the largest aviation organization dedicated to protecting the fun and unique places to fly all across this country.&nbsp;</p> <p>Almost daily, I hear a story or two about some random or planned activity that helps fulfill the RAF mission. Take Trigger Gap, 17A, near Bentonville, Arkansas. This place, and the people who have been a part of it since Day One embody Bill Bradley’s quote. An idea, fueled by passion –with a willingness to be persistent – turned a grassy hilltop into one of our country’s premier backcountry locations. A place open and accessible to anyone who takes a little time to learn about it, and considers their own capabilities.</p> <p>The Trigger Gap volunteer team began by building an enduring relationship with landowner The Nature Conservancy. Along the way, they leveraged funds from the RAF, and partners Fly Oz, and persistently turned that hilltop meadow into the premier place it is today that many of us have experienced. You can read more about the Trigger Gap story in this month’s edition. The Airfield Guide is a great place to find its airfield information.</p> <p>Other organizations ask us, “How do you do it?” I suspect they ask because it appears easy from the outside looking in. I can tell them the RAF story, but it would only make sense to them if they really understand that the RAF attracts the finest bunch of people that aviation has to offer.</p> <p>What strikes me most about all the persistent groups engaged in the RAF mission, like these Trigger Gap volunteers, is that they deserve our support. They truly are making a difference, and I hope along with me, you can find a way to help out as well. For sure go visit Trigger Gap, and explore the many other RAF places we are proud of. And, if you have yet to become a financial donor to the RAF, I would hope you will consider doing so. And if you don’t mind getting your hands a little dirty, then all you need to do is reach out and we will tell you how you too can help grow the mission of the RAF.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, with summer flying season on us, get out there and see what there is to see. Be mindful of others both in the air and on the ground, and above all, enjoy and be safe.</p> <p>&#8211; John McKenna, RAF Chairman</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 10, 2025.</em></p> ]]>

Keller himself drove 250 miles one way to oversee the group of volunteers.</p> <p>At the&nbsp;work party, volunteers installed a new windsock, repainted the segmented circle, and removed vegetation from the runway. “The winds came up later and really straightened out the windsock,” Keller added.</p> <p>Several years back,&nbsp;Keller had recognized Sacaton’s recreational value, with its proximity to the Gila Wilderness and 10,000-foot Mogollon Mountains. The airstrip had lain dormant and overgrown for four decades, so he approached the US Forest Service about cooperating on reopening it. In 2022, RAF and NMPA volunteers drove the many miles in and rehabilitated Sacaton, thanks to an RAF/Gila NF Challenge Cost Share agreement. Keller got approval for volunteers to install a vault toilet and access ramp at the trailhead into the Gila Wilderness. That project was completed in 2024.</p> <p>Visitors can enjoy direct access to the Gila Wilderness, and truly dark-</p> <p>sky stargazing in this remote place. “The experienced backpacker can hike miles into the Wilderness, and do some fishing. Rain Creek Trail, just northeast of the airstrip, is rated moderate to difficult, and is popular for its spectacular scenery,” Keller added.&nbsp;</p> <p>Anyone wishing to fly in to Sacaton, NM16 needs to contact USFS Gila Dispatch,&nbsp;800-538-1644 for permission to land.

Arkansas pilots and RAF Liaisons Harper Goodwin and Dave Powell connected with the regional folks at The Nature Conservancy, the organization known for its efforts to advance effective, lasting land and environmental conservation. Shortly, they found common ground between TNC and the RAF, as stewards and protectors of the outdoor places we visit. &nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF partnered with Fly Oz, and got enthusiastic support from TNC to shape a new 3,000-ft airfield from the beautiful grassy plateau above the Kings River on TNC land, just 29 nm east of Bentonville’s Louise Thaden field. It’s a popular destination for camping, hiking, and local outfitters can arrange float trips. Stay awhile, and you will likely make new like-minded friends as you gather around the evening campfire.</p> <p>The RAF helped fund the&nbsp;aesthetic pavilion built by volunteers, many of whom flew in from afar to help. Other amenities have been added for campers’ convenience, like a fire ring, picnic tables, and solar toilet.</p> <p>And when firewood needs to be restocked, or the batteries way down in the solar toilet need replacing, it’s willing volunteers like Goodwin and Powell who roll up their sleeves, and lean into the task. RAF Chairman John McKenna said, “The not so glamorous job of changing the batteries in the “pit” of the solar outhouse embodies the RAF willingness to serve.”</p> <p>The RAF and Fly Oz invite you to explore Trigger Gap, and the several other backcountry airfields in Ozark country. Thaden field, VBT is a great place to stage your travels.</p> <p>Find more on Trigger Gap and noise abatement requests in the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p>Submitted June 13, 2025</p> ]]>

The airfield provides access to the nearby Shiawassee River, and hosts an ever popular &#8216;ice cream Tuesdays&#8217; event in the summer season. RAF Michigan Liaison General Grant said, &#8220;Chesaning is a special airstrip to those living in Michigan. Its central location and warm hospitality draws everyone in.&#8221;</p> <p>Recently, Grant became aware that Chesaning had come under threat because of tree growth in the approaches to both runways 9/27 and 18/36. His request for regional help was abundantly answered. He reports that over 20 RAF and Chesaning Sportplane Association volunteers showed up to remove over 40 trees that were obstructing approaches or threatened to become a future safety issue. Volunteers were treated to a continental breakfast and lunch, provided by the Chesaning Sportplane Association. Grant added that Colt, the “airport canine patrol” was present.</p> <p>“Additionally, a huge thank you to arborist Nick Archer of One Call Tree Service,” Grant said. “He brought in heavy equipment and his skills to tackle the large trees that were close to utility services,” a task best completed by a professional. Mr. Archer also removed large debris piles, and chipped and removed branches, scrap, and cull timber.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a> for more information on Chesaning&#8217;s Howard Nixon Memorial Airport (50G).</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 11, 2025.</em></p> ]]>

The RAF discovered this slick pilot-tested product and is proud to feature them in the RAF Outfitter.</p> </div></div> <p>Raised in a family jewelry business,&nbsp;Sal&nbsp;handed out his first business card at age nine, promoting his snow shoveling enterprise. By age 14, he was taking flying lessons from barnstormer and world War II Navy flight instructor Sabbi Ludovici. “Sabbi was more concerned about correctly tying his airplane down than flying,”&nbsp;Sal&nbsp;said. He soloed shortly after his 16th birthday, and has been flying ever since, enjoying regular flights to AirVenture, Sun n’ Fun and other aviation events. And the importance of securing an airplane obviously lodged in his mind.</p> <p>Watching folks tie down their airplanes – some attacking their knot problem by just adding more knots – he knew there had to be a simpler solution. “I used a friend’s machine shop and after several design modifications, SlideDown was created,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sal&nbsp;had graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1983 and by 1984 he was in the commercial auction business, putting him literally in touch with a variety of industrial machinery. “By 2012, I got inspired to begin making these things. Through my liquidations, I started acquiring the equipment I needed so I could make them myself.”</p> <p>Rhode Island’s motto is simply “Hope” and&nbsp;Sal&nbsp;did a lot of that as he strolled past the hundreds of tied-down airplanes at Oshkosh, hoping he would not see anything that would make his design redundant. “I just&nbsp;<em>knew</em>&nbsp;they were out there somewhere.” But no one else had produced anything like his elegant “slide-down” design, so he decided, “I’m gonna make these things so the user doesn’t have to tie a knot. Sometimes, God puts you in just the right place,” he added, and explains that while camped at AirVenture’s North Forty, he became acquainted with the nearby campers. One happened to be a patent attorney, and helped him through that process.</p> <p>In 2013 he loaded a pallet of SlideDowns bound for AirVenture, “Including a return bill of lading for the whole shipment in case no one wanted them,” he said. Skeptical people would grab a set and ask,“Does this thing really work?” After a quick demo,&nbsp;Sal&nbsp;would make a sale, then another, then another. . . “By day five or six, we were completely sold out.” Aircraft Spruce saw the potential and became&nbsp;Sal’s first distributor. He learned how to apply graphics to the radial surface, and now you’ll see branded SlideDowns sporting logos like the RAF.&nbsp;Sal&nbsp;reached out to AOPA, and ever since the year of the prize Debonair, its sweepstakes aircraft includes a set. “AOPA doesn’t go anywhere without their SlideDowns,” he said.</p> <p>&nbsp;“Aviation is really my passion – always has been, and this business has connected me to people I’d never have met,”&nbsp;Sal&nbsp;says. He manages time to serve as president of the dynamic Rhode Island Pilot Association, and supports the RAF mission as well.</p> <p>Another of his passions is producing his popular product entirely in his own shop with local employees. He’s had offers to multiply sales if production goes offshore. “Not gonna happen,” he says. He’s seen the sad results when manufacturing leaves its home place in search of cheaper production. “That’s when I end up liquidating someone’s dream,” he said. Nearby Providence used to be the costume jewelry capital of the world, but those factories stand silent, no longer buzzing with activity. “I was looking to make a quality tie-down entirely in Rhode Island. That’s how we’ve grown this little company,” he says, and is fulfilling his native state’s adage of “hope.&#8221;</p> <p>Get your set at the&nbsp;<a href="https://outfitter.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RAF Outfitter</a>, and learn more about all SlideDown products&nbsp;<a href="https://slidedown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray<br>Submitted June 10, 2025</em></p> ]]>

Here’s an example of an RAF airstrip with a “smiling turtle.” &nbsp;</p> <p class="has-text-align-center">RYAN FIELD, MONTANA</p> <p>By now, most RAF supporters have either been to Ryan Field or seen one of the great videos telling the <a href="https://theraf.org/ryan-field/#the-ryans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story of Ben and Butchie Ryan</a>, and the many <a href="https://youtu.be/raXX1RGH1dw?si=Ww05NZ9ZOb7NV_fp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RAF projects completed</a> there by volunteers. </p> <p>The Ryans wanted to assure their vision lived on. The pilot visitor log at Ryan has been filled many times over with visitors literally from around the world. Another smiling turtle?</p> <p>Almost. Let’s meet three pilots originally from South Africa.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7230.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18348" style="width:572px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7230.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7230-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7230-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Otto, Klaas, and Adriaan</figcaption></figure></div> <p class="has-text-align-left">Otto, Klaas, and Adriaan are all Carbon Cub flyers. Maybe you’ve had the pleasure of their company at a backcountry airstrip somewhere in the US. Their story about why they are pursuing their flying interests 9,907 miles from home is worthy. They explain that the flying opportunity we all enjoy does not exist there, and they consider flying to places like Ryan a privilege, not a right. &nbsp;</p> <p>After enjoying the Ryan RAF fire ring and other improvements brought about by volunteers’ contributions and hard work, the three realized that someone had been there before to “give the turtle a lift up so it could enjoy the magic of the place.” They were motivated to help by what they witnessed others had done.</p> <p>Each flying season, volunteers fulfill the role as Ryan caretaker/host. They stay at their own expense typically for a commitment of two weeks. Recognizing the importance of this role, these three guys decided they could help “lift the turtle” by making a substantial lifetime gift to the RAF to build a sturdy host cabin, and it is now a comfortable, full-service abode nestled in the spectacular scenery with a view of the Ryan runway.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="720" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ryan-caretaker-cabin-exterior-by-Dan-Soto.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18337" style="width:560px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ryan-caretaker-cabin-exterior-by-Dan-Soto.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ryan-caretaker-cabin-exterior-by-Dan-Soto-300x216.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ryan-caretaker-cabin-exterior-by-Dan-Soto-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div> <p>RAF supporters may have a “pet project” on their Christmas want list, and if that project aligns with the RAF mission, the gift is accepted with gratitude and thanks.&nbsp;Such was the case with Otto, Klaas, and Adriaan’s generous gift, along with the other host cabin supporters.</p> <p>As we fly around the country to airfields the RAF supports, we quickly recognize that there are RAF supporters like these three guys from South Africa who have embraced and facilitated projects. These generous folks are “giving a turtle a lift from its limited view on the ground to so it can enjoy the magic of the place.”</p> <p>If you’re looking for a smiling turtle this backcountry flying season, explore the <a href="http://airfield.guide.theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.&nbsp;Take time to walk around and contemplate, <em>Just how did this place and everything you see get here?

They are smart tools that grow retirement assets during your lifetime. But do you have a strategy for these assets that you either don’t need, or wish to eventually pass to the kids, grandkids or charity? This may pleasantly surprise you: The IRS allows very attractive tax treatment during your, and your spouse’s lifetimes. But beware – the tax advantages after that time shift decidedly in favor of the taxman. So what to do?&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s a thought: As an RAF supporter, you can name the RAF as a secondary beneficiary of your IRA/401k during your lifetime, or any balance remaining in the account after the passing of both spouses. All you need to do is contact your IRA/401K plan administrator with your request. This request can be changed anytime during your lifetime if you so choose. Might you wish to name the RAF as a primary, partial, or backup beneficiary? We’d love to know.</p> <p><em>We’ll be sharing other tax tips — &nbsp;watch this space for other ways to maximize tax advantages while optimizing your wealth.

Historians say between 6,000 and 25,000 ships lie at the bottom of these five freshwater inland seas, most brought down by storms.</p> <p>Volunteers who flew in to help Grant were Scott Anttila, James Sciple, and Daniel Findling.&nbsp;</p> <p>Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>&nbsp;for further information on North Fox Island.</p> <p><em>Submitted on May 12, 2025.</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Some of those radios are more than 30 years old. Much of the infrastructure dates back to the 1970s. “This technology is 50 years old that our controllers use to scan the skies and keep airplanes separated from one another,” Secretary Duffy (AP).</p> <p>The plan includes creating six new FAA air traffic control centers, building 15 new towers combined with Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities at airports across the country; and the replacement of 618 US radar systems.</p> <p>“Although ATC might not appear to be a concern of the RAF, modernization of the system is paramount to all who fly. The RAF is an active partner in this effort,&#8221; says RAF Chairman John McKenna.</p> <p>The digital equipment upgrade is expected to be more reliable and will provide more clarity, as well as making the system more secure.</p> <p><a href="https://modernskies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Modern-Skies-Coalition-Supports-Secretary-Duffys-ATC-Modernization-Plan-05.08.25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">View the full Modern Skies Coalition statement.</a></p> <p><em>Submitted May 13, 2025<br>By Carmine Mowbray<br>Photo by Cameron Donough</em></p> ]]>

It&#8217;s visiting special places where the laptop and briefcase aren’t coming along. The RAF supports recreational destinations with a grassroots feel, where there are no instrument procedures, and your radio only need be tuned to contact any others who may be in your vicinity.</p> <p>Maybe your idea of recreation is landing on a turf airfield for a picnic with family and friends. Maybe it’s an overnight at an airport sharing views of the night sky with an astronomy club. Or tying down and joining a field trip to experience the miracle of a million birds on their migratory flight. The RAF supports one airfield alongside a national blueway, where visitors enjoy local dining and the opera house productions just a short walk away. How about landing at a South Dakota airfield in the middle of a picturesque blooming garden to pick flowers? No matter your preference, you appreciate amenities at these places, like shade canopies, picnic tables, fire rings, and sanitary facilities.</p> <p>Maybe you relish the experience of using your mountain flying skills to land at a backcountry trailhead, then camp a night at the airstrip before that long hike into a Wilderness Area. You appreciate the luxury of a vault toilet nearby, a tent platform above the rocky ground, and a dry place to set up your camp stove for your freeze-dried dinner.</p> <p>Whatever your idea of “recreation” is, the RAF is serious about its mission to preserve, improve, and create airstrips for recreational access, and invests volunteer labor, RAF grants, and other resources to help provide these improvements throughout our entire country – be it the public lands of the West, the quiet prairies in the middle, or the private gems in the East.</p> <p>And you can learn more about them in our<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Airfield Guide</a>.

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Ron Keller, the RAF&#8217;s New Mexico Liaison.</em></p> <p>My interest in aviation started as a child on our small farm in Ohio. When I saw an airplane fly overhead, I always wondered what the world looked like from up there. My first introduction to aviation was during my enlistment in the US Air Force, as an aircraft instrument systems specialist, maintaining fixed and rotary-wing aircraft at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque. After my enlistment, I continued the profession at Kirtland, then designed, constructed and maintained electrical systems on Cockpit Procedure Trainers for the same group.</p> <p>But I missed working on&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;aircraft, so I obtained a full-time position with the NM Air National Guard and maintained electrical and avionics systems on several aircraft, including F-16s. As really good luck would have it, the FAA needed experienced electronics technicians, and I was hired as a radar technician at Albuquerque ATCT. After 9/11, I was promoted to maintenance coordinator for radar, ILS, VOR, and communications. I retired from federal civil service in 2011. For the next three years I served as aviation safety and education administrator for the NM Aviation Division, until my wife retired.</p> <p>My father-in-law was a CFII, so I started flying lessons through the Air Force Aero Club in Albuquerque and earned my private pilot certificate in 1984. He helped me select my first airplane, a 1955 Cessna 170B, and he checked me out for my tailwheel endorsement.</p> <p>Soon, I started landing at a backcountry airstrip next to property my in-laws owned. When the New Mexico Pilots Association formed a backcountry group in 2010, I volunteered to help former RAF NM Liaison Larry Filener, and met the RAF. We teamed up with many dedicated volunteers to begin improving Negrito, a USFS airstrip. The District Ranger was pro-aviation and allowed us to get to work. Because we were able to prove our worth as a volunteer team with a strong RAF-NMPA partnership, we were allowed to continue making improvements and having fly-ins. In 2014 we formed the New Mexico Airstrip Network, 13 partners who support recreational aviation opportunities. The RAF is a highly valued partner.</p> <p>In 2016 I was asked to become an RAF Liaison. I was relieved that most of the duties were tasks I’d already been doing for several years. My wife Mary Ann was so impressed with the RAF way of doing things, she supported me becoming a Liaison as a great way for me to “give back” to aviation.</p> <p>As Liaison, I work with private landowners, the State of New Mexico, US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and local governments. There are challenges common to each agency. The turnover rate among key personnel is substantial. This makes it necessary to make new introductions and establish good working relationships.</p> <p>Airstrip maintenance is a “dirty job,&#8221; so I bought a tractor, mower, disc, and seeder. A great pilot friend donated a box blade. A custom drag was also added to the list. Mowing, dragging, and replacing windsocks was accomplished, and many rewarding projects followed, such as installing an accessible vault toilet at Negrito. In 2020 we received permission from the USFS to rehabilitate Rainy Mesa, an airstrip that had been dormant for over 40 years. Small trees had to be cleared, and we really worked the tractor, blade and drag. Several work parties later, and with a dedicated core of volunteers, Rainy Mesa was registered and reopened.</p> <p>In 2022, after the RAF/Gila NF Challenge Cost Share agreement was signed, we rehabilitated Sacaton airstrip after four decades of dormancy. A good pilot friend and I put our tractors and blades to work, along with another great crew. It was registered and charted and is a gem of a location just outside a wilderness boundary. Before the delivery of the new vault toilet, I drove the route and measured 11 cattle guards to ensure the semi-truck and trailer could fit through them all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Being an RAF Liaison is challenging sometimes, but always rewarding. I particularly enjoy overseeing a project from start to finish like the rehabilitation and reopening of airstrips. I also cherish the solitude available when I am mowing all six USFS-managed airstrips on the Gila National Forest. No matter how big an airstrip project may be, it is the satisfaction of knowing it will make a difference for generations to come.</p> <p>In closing, I obviously enjoy flying in the backcountry. Also, very rewarding are the opportunities to make a difference in “preserving, improving, and creating airstrips for recreational access.”</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:41% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ron-Keller-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4462 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ron-Keller-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ron-Keller-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ron-Keller-768x432.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ron-Keller-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ron-Keller.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Ron learned to fly through an Air Force aero club, and in 1984 at the age of 27, he earned his private certificate.

He is the IT manager for the company that operates the largest, most diverse private aircraft fleet in the world, hangs out weekends at his active local GA airport, AND is willing and able to volunteer his skills for the RAF. Steve helps manage the RAF&#8217;s data systems, bringing his “back shop” tech knowledge to make sure things run seamlessly on the front end.</p> <p>Maybe being born and raised in Columbus, Ohio – so close to the birthplace of powered aviation – has something to do with his passion.&nbsp;Steve began his aviation journey as a CAP cadet, and earned his PPL and tailwheel&nbsp;endorsement.&nbsp;He graduated from Ohio State University with a BA in Aviation Management, then embarked on his career in the aviation industry.&nbsp;He met his wife Kasey at NetJets, where Steve is fulfilling his twenty-first&nbsp;year, and they live in Pickerington, Ohio. Kasey is a Product Business Analyst for an aviation software company.</p> <p>When Steve met RAF Ohio Liaison Christine Mortine at an AOPA “Peaks to Pavement” event, “It opened my eyes to backcountry flying, and I’ve never gone back to ‘traditional flying,&#8217; preferring grass strips,” he says. “I’m really looking forward to flying into places like North Fox Island,” he added. In addition to his volunteer time for the RAF at his desk, he has helped make improvements at Noble County Airport adjacent to Wolf Run State Park, where folks can fly in and camp near the lakeshore. Kasey supports his passion, and is encouraging him to buy an airplane so they can both enjoy exercising their piloting skills. He would love to own and fly a Sport Cub or a stock SuperCub.</p> <p>His local airport, Fairfield County in Lancaster, has an active pilots organization, EAA chapter, and historical aircraft&nbsp;museum right at the airport. There is also an Aviation Career Center nearby that has educational and mentoring programs for young people. Steve remains active in CAP where he got his aviation start.</p> <p>Steve and Kasey love traveling, and it’s likely wherever they go, a winery or local airport is typically a place they visit. Once they get that taildragger, all they will need is the current VFR chart and the <a href="http://airfield.guide.theraf.org/">RAF Airfield Guide</a> to plan&nbsp;new adventures.</p> <p><em>Submitted May 13, 2025<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

While these gifts are vital, there&#8217;s another way to give that can have an even greater impact: recurring donations.</p> <p>Did you know you can set your RAF donation to recur automatically, at your preferred frequency? This allows you to set a schedule to donate your chosen amount, on your chosen time-frame. And don&#8217;t worry about forgetting that you set the schedule; you&#8217;ll receive an email reminder five days before the donation gets processed, as well as a confirmation email after it goes through. If you ever want to change or cancel the schedule, we&#8217;re here to help at <a href="mailto:contact@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact@theraf.org</a> or 406-582-1723.</p> <p>To set a recurring donation schedule, simply <a href="https://secure.theraf.org/np/clients/theraf/donation.jsp?forwardedFromSecureDomain=1&amp;campaign=19">use our normal online donation form</a>. After entering your donation amount, select the option to &#8220;Make this a recurring contribution deducted&#8230;&#8221; and select the frequency with which you want to donate that amount. </p> <p>Recurring giving is a convenient and effective way to make a difference. It&#8217;s easy to set up, fits into any budget, and provides the satisfaction of knowing that you&#8217;re making an ongoing investment in a cause you care about.</p> <p><em>Photo by Ray &amp; Lisa Ballantyne</em><br><em>Submitted April 30, 2025</em></p> ]]>

Sharples Award at their annual Hoover awards reception on March 19 in the historic Terminal A Lobby at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.</p> <p>AOPA Chairman Darren Pleasance introduced Russell, saying, “This is AOPA’s most important award, named after AOPA’s first chairman, and recognizes someone for their extraordinary contributions to General Aviation.” Accepting the plaque, Russell modestly claimed that the award was really earned by the entire RAF, thanks to many other volunteers within the organization. He returned to his seat to a standing ovation.</p> <p>“I could not be more proud of our fellow RAF Director Jeff who was recognized by AOPA. We can all be proud of his many accomplishments,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said after attending the reception. “Jeff has done enormous work moving the RAF mission along on both public and private lands. He&#8217;s a ‘one man army’ when it comes to getting things done.”&nbsp;<br><br>After a long career in manufacturing, Russell got involved with the RAF first as Wisconsin Liaison, then accepted a position on the board. He is credited with preserving Cornucopia Airport by enlisting town leadership and volunteers to make improvements to serve visiting pilots. Each year, hundreds of aircraft enjoy parking on its turf, camping, sightseeing around Lake Superior, and taking advantage of the town’s warm hospitality.&nbsp;Along with Jeff&#8217;s efforts in Wisconsin, he works with local volunteers in Alaska on their airstrip projects. Jeff led the RAF&#8217;s advocacy effort of&nbsp;working with the FAA on advancing turf operating areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Russell flies his Super Cub around the lower 48, Canada, and Alaska on either Bushwheels, floats, or skis, typically to work parties, or speaking to groups promoting RAF support. He has worked to protect many backcountry aviation destinations.</p> <p>“I’m blown away by the company I’m in. The previous recipients are truly amazing people,” Russell said after learning he’d been selected for the honor.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WntdVi5yQlA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">See AOPA’s two-minute video&nbsp;</a>about Jeff and his love of flying and giving back.&nbsp;</p> <p>RAF supporter Dan Schwinn of Avidyne won the Richard G.

Jake happily volunteers his time providing all this work for the RAF, and it is greatly appreciated.<br><br>Jake has always loved the outdoors, having grown up in California&#8217;s Sierra Nevada Mountains. His entire life has included the world of photography, as well. His father, B Moose Peterson has been a professional wildlife photographer for 40 years and his mother, Sharon manages the business. Much of Moose and Sharon’s career, before moving to Montana in 2020, has been working with California’s threatened and endangered species including several that are now extinct. Moose’s work with Nikon placed him at the Reno Air Races to help educate other photographers. The whole family eventually became part of the Reno Air Race Association media team. In 2009 at the Pylon Race Seminar Jake says he found his love for aviation, then got involved photographing other classes of general aviation. His family worked together when they were hired for a three year documentary project for the Texas Flying Legends Museum. “The War Birds intrigue us most. We hear great stories, and meet great people,” Jake says.</p> <p>After attending Montana State University in Bozeman, “Like so many other people, after four years I decided to stay in Bozeman,” Jake said. Currently, he is the production manager for the Wrap Agency, a nationwide graphics producer specializing in vehicle wraps, wall wraps, civic beautification, decals, banners, and more. His off-time is devoted to his photography business, including much work for nonprofits, like the RAF, the Commemorative Air Force Big Sky wing in Bozeman, and the Montana Antique Aircraft Association. “There’s always something going on there, and good energy,” he says. “I like that it enables me to make new friends, and go to new places. Everyone in aviation has been wonderful,” he adds.</p> <p>His love of the outdoors and pursuing his art of photography is a great blend resulting in wildlife and aviation photography that has earned him recognition in the professional realm, having published numerous articles and photographs in a variety of publications.</p> <p>Jake approaches his art as a skilled pilot approaches aviation – always learning, respectfully open to new technology and skills. Regarding the emergence of digital photo manipulation, he says, “For me there’s a distinction between a photograph and digital ‘art’. There’s a place for technology in photography. Even Ansel Adams modified his originals in his darkroom.” He points out the difference between authentic imagery for scientific purposes for example; and the artistic direction a photographer can take. “Galleries display beautiful wildlife photos that are pleasing to the eye — perfect, unlike reality. But that’s art,” he says. “Each is valid. It’s up to the individual to decide.”</p> <p>The RAF values Jake’s volunteer work. It’s obvious that after working many airshows and fly-ins, his love for aviation has remained, as has his passion to continue capturing romantic and interesting photographs, and like a pilot seeking new challenges, further advance his own knowledge.</p> ]]>

It all starts with building a relationship. Relationships truly make things happen. What you’ll note generally about a strong relationship is that it’s built on a shared personal connection. Not one designed to drive clicks, but rather one that motivates a desire for more engagement with one another, and in turn, with an organization like the RAF.</p> <p>Here’s one highlight of what I’m talking about. Just recently, volunteers took on the task of moving the RAF Fire Hub from Texas to South Carolina. As we reinstalled it, I was fortunate to stand shoulder to shoulder with volunteers and longtime friends John “JC” Carroll, Paul Iverson, Steve and Rachel Thompson, and of course Triple Tree founder Pat Hartness. We raked and leveled the ground, installed brick, and made a welcoming site for future Triple Tree campfire gatherings. This was not an AI generated project.</p> <p>Another highlight was the one-hour flight in our 185 with RAF friends. It was a blue sky, “Big Sky” day. As Charlie Gregoire of Texas reminded me during our flight over Yellowstone National Park and into Driggs, Idaho at the base of the Tetons, “We are some of the most fortunate people on the planet, without this unique touch to aviation and one another, who knows what dull corner of life we might have ended up in?”</p> <p>When we got news that one of the RAF family had lost a grandson in an accident we shared a deep sense of loss. This is who we are. We can laugh around a campfire with not a care, then we take care and embrace our friends at these most difficult times.</p> <p>And finally, Bill McGlynn and I shared time in Washington State at the Northwest Aviation conference with friends. In addition, we had the opportunity to begin another great friendship with AOPA’s new President Darren Pleasance. Looks like he’s an RAF kind of guy, and sure to be an AOPA leader we’ll all be proud of.</p> <p>In closing, it’s all of these friendships and relationships that fuel the RAF mission. Thanks to each of you for throwing an extra log of authentic passion on the RAF fire.</p> <p>&#8211; John McKenna, RAF Chairman</p> <p><em>Submitted on March 11, 2025.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by John Nadeau, one of the RAF&#8217;s RUS Liaisons and a longtime RAF supporter.</em></p> <p>When Opportunity Knocks, Open the Door – Better Yet, Knock First – Opportunity May Be Lurking</p> <p>The first grass runway I landed on was the one I owned. I had an opportunity to purchase an airfield before buying an airplane. The runway had been neglected for over a decade. As a physical therapist, I felt a need to&nbsp;&#8220;rehabilitate&#8221;&nbsp;it. For ten years, I’d rented Cessna 150s, flying pavement to pavement from a very busy, towered airport just west of Boston,&nbsp;Mass. Suddenly I owned a grass airfield in Maine. This sort of opportunity just doesn’t come up very often.&nbsp;</p> <p>That first summer was spent plucking young birch trees, filling holes and mowing ten-year long grass and weeds. I literally worked a good riding lawn mower to a nasty demise. I allowed other pilots to access the airfield, but liability was always a major concern.&nbsp;</p> <p>Circa 2007, a blurb appeared in&nbsp;<em>AOPA Pilot</em>&nbsp;that caught my eye. A group based in Montana calling itself the Recreational Aviation Foundation had just gotten the State of Montana to add “aviation” to its Recreational Use Statute (RUS).</p> <p>I called the phone number. On the other end John McKenna explained the RAF, and that an RUS limits the liability of airfield owners. I had saved an abandoned airfield and wanted&nbsp;that&nbsp;liability protection – another opportunity.</p> <p>Recreational Use Statutes basically state that if a landowner keeps land open to the public for recreational purposes, and does not charge a fee, and there is no malicious intent to injure others, then the owner is not responsible if someone using the land is injured. Some states list recreational purposes, preceded with the phrase, “…including but not limited to…” Aviation for recreational purposes may be implied, but airfield owners tend to want to see it in black and white in the RUS.</p> <p>We wanted to add “aviation” to Maine’s RUS. It took two years to get through the legislative process.&nbsp;Maine pilots&nbsp;and other airfield owners, as well as the RAF helped. Once “aviation” was added to Maine’s RUS, use of my airfield became “free” for all. &nbsp;</p> <p>John called me with the opportunity to participate in an RAF Strategic Planning Conference in Driggs, Idaho, adding, “Come out a couple of days early and we will fly you around a bit.” Enter Tim Clifford, and RAF co-founders Chuck Jarecki, Jerry Cain, and Dan Prill. What a fun opportunity! I met some wonderful and interesting people, as you can imagine.</p> <p>During the conference, John offered me the opportunity to lead the RAF’s national effort to include aviation in each state’s RUS. At the time, there were&nbsp;only&nbsp;five states. He had just arranged to have me flown all over creation in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp;He had me&nbsp;hooked, netted, and landed.</p> <p>I acquired the help of Bob Kay and Dave Myrick. We started a campaign to get this done. The opportunity for additional aviation destinations was unimaginable… if only RUS liability protection could be assured in the minds of the private-use airfield owners.&nbsp;</p> <p>I knew nothing about owning an airfield, nor the process of getting a bill through state government. Same for Bob Kay (Boeing test pilot) and Dave Myrick (artisan glass blower). But as people volunteered to lead their own state’s effort, we grabbed these opportunities and got ‘er done. We learned more as we went along from state to state, advising RAF volunteers and airfield owners about the legislative process. We simply used the experiences we had gained, team effort, persistence, pleasantness, generosity and patience. Today there are 28 states that include aviation in their definition of recreation. Four states have no list but merely state generically, “recreation,” so we assume aviation is implied.</p> <p>Recently RAF Supporter Rick McCraw of Vermont has stepped up, and he and I are available to answer RUS questions. Eighteen states still don’t specify “aviation” in their RUS, and airfield owners in these states&nbsp;need aviation language to be included.</p> <p>So, I encourage you to open the door when opportunities knock, even if it’s all new to you. And don’t just wait for that knock. Rap on some doors yourself. Speak to airfield owners about RUS protections and airfield maintenance needs. An opportunity may be waiting within each conversation. Your knock may even be answered by someone who’ll lead the charge to add aviation language into one of those&nbsp;remaining&nbsp;18 states’ Recreational Use Statutes. &nbsp;</p> <p>It&nbsp;sure&nbsp;has been a&nbsp;fun and&nbsp;satisfying ride for me.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/John-Nadeau-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9020 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>A physical therapist, John started a unique practice in 1975 that treated children and young adults with cystic&nbsp;fibrosis (CF) with daily chest physical therapy in their homes before and after school/work.

Though his practice survives today, CF research has made tremendous advancements in medical treatment, diminishing the need for his services just in time for his retirement. </em></p> </div></div> <p><em>Flying his Cessna Skyhawk provided 35 years of stress relief and sanity from fighting medical insurance&nbsp;companies on behalf of young terminally ill patients.</em></p> <p><em>Photo: John with Eli, John’s grandson and future pilot extraordinaire</em></p> <p><em>Submitted January 17, 2025</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

By his mid-20s, with some “hard-earned wisdom from his travels,” he pursued a business management degree. A serendipitous vocational placement test revealed his natural aptitude for aviation – a field that promised what Douglass calls, the “perfect blend of adventure and technical challenge.”</p> <p>Douglas immersed himself in the aviation world earning his A&amp;P license and PPL with love for aircraft restoration. He often traded extra maintenance work for precious flight time.</p> <p>“Everything about aviation resonated with me – from the details of maintenance to the continuous learning and pure joy of stick-and-rudder flying,” he says. His favorite pastime was gaining experience backcountry flying all around the Southwest and Baja in a mix of aircraft. “I was thrilled to be instructing and flying in a number of aircraft, including Stearmans and Twin Beach D-18s. The desire for new adventures and challenges drew me to fly my Cessna 170 up to Alaska for a season where I worked in Ketchikan as an A&amp;P and Cessna 206 pilot.”</p> <p>Back in Southern California in the mid-90s, he explains, “life took an interesting turn. While flying a C320 for owners of a winery and vineyard estate in Sonoma County, I was asked to step in as general manager.” He stayed in that role until retiring in 2022, spending his spare time continuing his passion for backcountry flying and instruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2014, he’d taken on the restoration of a wrecked Husky on amphibs and had it in the air by 2016. Since then, he&#8217;s flown it extensively on wheels and floats throughout the western US, British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska. “I love giving instruction in tailwheel and backcountry flying, helping pilots find the techniques that work for them,” he says. &nbsp;</p> <p>He lives in Sonoma County with his wife Julie, who shares his enthusiasm for flying adventures and the aviation community.</p> <p>Douglas is thrilled to serve the RAF. &#8220;I’m excited to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts who share my&nbsp;dedication to promoting, enjoying, and preserving&nbsp;recreational&nbsp;aviation.&#8221;</p> <p><a href="mailto:dlumgair@theraf.org">dlumgair@theraf.org</a><br>(707) 484-6418</p> ]]>

His father’s friend founded West Virginia’s Aeronautics department and flew the governor, which gave Robert a glimpse into the world of aviation. Robert initially studied in the medical field, then “made a hard right” and decided to pursue his passion for aviation when he realized it was a possibility, and he began earning his ratings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Starting in corporate aviation flying several Cessna models, a King Air and a Citation, his airline career began with Henson/Piedmont on the Beech 99, Shorts 330 “Box with wings”, and the STOL four engine Dash 7, “where we’d get cleared for Washington, DC’s crosswind runway and stop before the traffic using the main runway,” he explains. Finally landing his dream job at Piedmont Airlines, “I came out the other side, retiring from American Airlines,” he says. During that career, he took time to practice his interest in mountain flying, and in 2000 he bought his C185 that he still enjoys flying today. He flew the Idaho and Montana backcountry with Lori MacNichol&nbsp;and Amy Hoover. “I love everything about the serenity, the beauty, where you can be by yourself or be as social as you want,” he says.</p> <p>“My hobby is to take a nice piece of land, and turn it into something pretty,” he says. His definition of pretty? An airfield! And he has done just that, four times, beginning in West Virginia, where he built “a crooked one way in, one way out airfield.” While living and working ten years in the Seattle area, he built a 1,200-ft strip on land he turned so beautiful it became a wedding venue. Flying in that area included exploring the nearby Olympic and Cascade Mountains, and San Juan Island airfields.&nbsp;</p> <p>His love of the Montana and Idaho mountains drew him a bit east, where he spent ten years living on a beautiful airfield he built on the Flathead River just east of Kalispell City airport. While living there, he volunteered for many work parties at Ryan Field.</p> <p>With his experience and love of mountain flying, Robert has flown many volunteer delivery missions for the RAF throughout US Forest Service cooperative projects. He made multiple deliveries of USFS personnel, AmeriCorps and RAF volunteers, construction materials, meal supplies, and “even the camp cook and his dog&#8221; into Moose Creek USFS airstrip. Daher donated the use of both the Kodiak 100 and 900 for the project. Using the 900, he brought a full load of shingles into Shearer’s 2,000 x15-ft runway.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="707" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-06-at-2.21.25 PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-17981" style="width:576px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-06-at-2.21.25 PM.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-06-at-2.21.25 PM-300x212.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-06-at-2.21.25 PM-768x543.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div> <p>Considering his accumulation of off-the-pavement flying experiences, it makes sense that Robert bases his flying decisions on a foundation of safety. He made an informal presentation on safely flying Idaho’s backcountry to a group of pilots at his local airport, and will present again in Lexington. He appreciates the RAF emphasis on safety and respect for the backcountry, especially with today’s social media’s videos of risky behavior, “It’s the new normal,” he says.</p> <p>Now he and his fiancée have settled back east near Lexington, Kentucky, where they turned another large parcel of land into something pretty – an airfield surrounded by the neighbor’s thousand-acre horse farm, and a vineyard. They like to fly low and slow over the bluegrass country, and look at horse farms. “There must be a hundred thousand miles of white rail fencing around Lexington,” he notes. “It’s a different kind of beauty.”</p> <p>Robert wants to help the RAF expand flying destinations in Kentucky and West Virginia for its abundant hiking, whitewater sports, and climbing opportunities. Now recreational flying in this scenic and historic part of the country is becoming another attraction for visitors.</p> <p><em>Submitted March 13, 2025<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

It offers camping under the dark Utah sky in a wilderness-type setting. It’s a quarter-mile walk to the Green River for catch and release fishing in a wild and scenic river that is incredibly difficult to get to, except by air.”</p> <p>The BLM is obligated to conduct an Environmental Assessment. Public comments should cover all points for why this airstrip is beneficial to the public and the environment, potential resource issues, and alternatives. It’s likely there will be comments opposing this proposal. Please use these talking points and&nbsp;<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2034635/570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submit substantive comments&nbsp;<strong>in your own words</strong>&nbsp;here before April 3, 2025.</a>&nbsp;Once you click the link, select the green &#8220;Participate Now&#8221; section on the left to enter your comment. Please be patient while the Participate Now link loads.</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resources</span>:&nbsp;Taylor Flat is a previously established but abandoned airstrip, on previously disturbed ground. No new construction or alteration of this primitive airstrip is needed.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical/Cultural Resources</span>:&nbsp;Takeoffs, landings, and dispersed use will not create any new impact to cultural and historical artifacts.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alternatives</span>:&nbsp;Dutch John Airport (33U) is only a 7 minute flight (an hour by ground)&nbsp;from Taylor Flat, but has no access to the Green River without ground transportation. No other Utah airstrip in Utah offers catch-and-release fishing in the Green River a short hike from the airstrip.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Airstrip Maintenance</span>:&nbsp;Volunteer pilot organizations have committed to maintaining Utah’s backcountry airstrips, at no cost to the BLM or taxpayers.&nbsp;</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Impacts to wildlife and water resources</span>:&nbsp;Surface and groundwater, and fisheries are not affected by this airstrip. Pilots may access the airstrip for hunting season. Bird strikes by small aircraft are incredibly rare, even in migratory bird corridors. The portion of the airstrip under consideration is purposely outside of the environmentally sensitive area and the Green River wild and scenic river corridor.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Noise impacts</span>:&nbsp;Noise from aircraft is short-term and transient. There is scientific evidence that recreational aircraft do not adversely impact wildlife.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visual Impact</span>:&nbsp;Taylor Flat Airstrip is not conspicuous due to natural vegetation surrounding the airstrip.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cumulative Impacts</span>:&nbsp;Taylor Flat Airstrip will provide for dispersed, primitive camping, and will relieve use on nearby campgrounds. Visitors may access nearby Jarvie Historical site.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BLM Consultation</span>:&nbsp;BLM should consider UBCP and RAF input as they advance decisionmaking on Taylor Flat Airstrip. These pilot groups have a wealth of knowledge and can help the BLM retain compatibility with the surrounding environment.</li> <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recreation</span>:&nbsp;This backcountry airstrip adds opportunity for recreational enjoyment, it has added meaningful personal experience … (your personal remarks here.)</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Comment deadline: April 3, 2025.

He already had a mindset of a backcountry pilot and flew his Glasair Sportsman; he used that acquired passion to help the RAF make new aviation connections through his leadership role with the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA). &#8220;We could always count on Pete to help direct us on policy issues with public agencies and he would frequently draft others into creating solutions,” McKenna explained. Most notably, Bunce&nbsp;created the GRAF – the backcountry flying addition to GAMA’s annual strategy meeting, where members of the RAF board joined GAMA board members on backcountry flying adventures. It has become an annual highlight for both organizations and is held in varied places across the US – proving there are backcountry opportunities everywhere. Bunce remains passionate about the RAF mission and that will no doubt continue in and around his home state of Wisconsin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Todd Simmons, Cirrus Aircraft’s President of Customer Experience, brought his inspiration to the RAF in 2017, at a critical time in the evolution of the organization. The RAF was on a growth streak and&nbsp;intent on its&nbsp;mission, but was challenged to best portray it in rapidly evolving media.&nbsp;Simmons&nbsp;dove in with a team of talented marketing consultants. He assembled a diverse committee of RAF supporters who spent two days&nbsp;at the Museum of Flight in Seattle&nbsp;working on brand strategy. The outcome was a plethora of new approaches to communications, including a brand book emphasizing the&nbsp;spirit&nbsp;of the&nbsp;mission, and a&nbsp;style guide for identity consistency.&nbsp;A significant outcome was the simplified RAF logo that is easily recognized. He continued to lean in and help with the design of the RAF Outfitter Store, and helped build relationships with&nbsp;Garmin and Bose.&nbsp;He initiated the RAF’s first inReach campaign to put what he feels&nbsp;is “the most important piece of survival gear in the hands of as many backcountry flyers as possible, the InReach Mini.”&nbsp;RAF President Bill McGlynn said, &#8220;Todd served on our board for six years but his contributions will endure for the life of the RAF.&#8221;&nbsp;</p> <p>&#8220;The RAF is enriched by the time and care that these two industry leaders have shared with us . . . we appreciate their time, care, and love for the mission more than words can say,&#8221; McKenna says, adding, &#8220;While Pete and Todd have stepped away from the Board&#8217;s day-to-day roles, they continue to be involved and are just a phone call away.&#8221;</p> <p><em>Submitted February 28, 2025</em></p> ]]>

This means that when you book a ticket on Delta, the RAF can receive points for your travel. It does NOT affect any of your SkyMiles or other bonus programs. It is purely a benefit to the RAF. We can redeem the points we earn through your travel for benefits on Delta, and receive tickets for the RAF to travel to events.</p> <p>Below are the directions for how to sign up. When you add the RAF as your business loyalty program in your SkyMiles account, it stays in your profile, eliminating the need to put our SkyMiles number in each time you book a ticket.</p> <p>Instructions:</p> <p>1. On the Delta homepage, login to your SkyMiles account<br>2. Under “SkyMiles” at the top of the page, navigate to “Manage Your Account”<br>3. Under “My Profile” click on “Other Loyalty Programs”<br>5. Under “Business Loyalty Programs”, click &#8220;+Add&#8221; in the &#8220;Business Travel Program&#8221; section and select &#8220;Delta SkyMiles for Business&#8221;<br>6. Enter Loyalty # <strong>US0056924 </strong>and click &#8220;Save&#8221;</p> <p>After doing this, the ID should auto populate on the &#8220;Passenger Info&#8221; page whenever you are booking while logged-in.</p> <p>If you book by phone, with a travel agent or a Delta Representative, you will need to provide the booking agent with our loyalty number, US0056924. Please ask your travel agent to place the SkyMiles for Business ID in the Tour Code Box. Tickets issued by Expedia, Travelocity, etc, will need to be manually entered to your SkyBonus account in order to earn credit. These types of travel sites do not have a place in which you can add the company’s SkyMiles for Business ID.</p> <p><em>Featured photo by Jim Stevenson</em><br><em>Submitted February 18, 2025</em></p> ]]>

He and his wife Cindy are some of the few folks who call it home year round, as it gets pretty quiet when the Park closes for the season and heavy snows blanket the forest.</p> <p>“I discovered the RAF at AOPA’s Missoula&nbsp;fly-in,” he said. When he and Cindy&nbsp;built their home on family land in Apgar, near Ryan Field, “I reached out to see if they might need occasional assistance. Little did I know if you raise your hand around this outfit, be prepared to have someone grab it, give it a hearty shake and hand you a shovel,” he says. Dave has volunteered to be the local go-to guy if something needs to be done on the Ryan property, a great deal of&nbsp;help&nbsp;for the RAF.</p> <p>Dave&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;manages his profession, overseeing field operations for the largest crop insurer in the U.S. and Canada. “We insure everything from corn to clams, cows to citrus,” he says.</p> <p>Dave grew up on a grain farm north of Great Falls.&nbsp;He was exposed to flying by his father who was a crew chief for the Montana National Guard, and involved in the CAP.&nbsp;Dave took his first flight lesson from a local spray pilot in October of 1973. He learned to fly from a North-South grass airstrip just off the notoriously windy east slope of the Rocky Mountain Front, and logged hours in and out of the small airports of Conrad, Fairfield, Dutton and Choteau. The Great Falls Tribune reported that Montana&#8217;s highest recorded wind gust came in 2002 at 143 mph near Choteau. ”I developed good crosswind skills,” Dave says. He solo’d before he turned 16, so the instructor had to “post-date” his logbook entry.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I added my commercial, instrument, CFI, and AI credentials at Sunbird Aviation in Bozeman while attending Montana State University.” Upon returning from Bozeman, he started a flight school with two Cessna 150s based out of Choteau. “I used one 150 as a Jeep,” he quips.</p> <p>A grain buyer who had gotten into the insurance business invited Dave to “get an airplane and we’ll go visit agents,” and Dave’s career literally took off, first in a Cessna 210, then a Beech Baron. One year, Dave recalls he was “271 day days straight on the road.” Over the past 40-plus years, he’s&nbsp;flown into or over 49 of the 50 states, and four Canadian provinces with stays in Barrow, Deadhorse, Prudhoe Bay, and Nome, in Alaska (and twice flew around Denali in VFR), Churchill, Manitoba;&nbsp;Yellowknife, Northwest Territories; and Rankin Inlet in Nunavut, and points in between.</p> <p>He came to a decision when his son was born, “Did I want to be a nomad or a father,” and he stepped out of aviation for 20 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>A backcountry seminar re-ignited his passion for flying, and he got current, and between 2015 and 2017 completed a Vans 14 – it only took him two years to complete the aircraft, and its&nbsp;20,500 rivets.&nbsp;“I’m a typical farmer, I have a tool hobby. Good thing I don’t live too close to a tool warehouse,” he says. Dave flew his homebuilt to Oshkosh, and it earned him a Bronze Lindy at AirVenture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having accumulated around 4,000 hours so far, Dave and Cindy enjoy their RV-14 and use it for pleasure trips. Their son works in Missoula, and their daughter is an attorney for the State of Montana in Helena.</p> <p>Facing eventual retirement, Dave had wondered how he could build a new community. It seems he’s found it. “The folks I’ve met through the RAF are all fantastic. It’s a unique collection of folks, all with passion for saving these airfields,” he says.</p> <p><em>Submitted February 12, 2025<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

RAF Oregon Ambassador Kevin Johnson aided by RAF Supporter Jay PerryCook, developed a prototype and budget for the kiosk, where visitors will be able to charge their devices, and view RAF information and general notices, protected from the weather. The design can be used for other locations, and RAF Supporter Sherry Sherod is helping fund this and other airfield kiosks in memory of her husband, William Neal Sherod, an experienced bush pilot.<br><br>Johnson has volunteered to assemble the materials and transport them to the site. PerryCook will supply his hydraulic drill. The local EAA Chapter 430 is providing volunteers for the project. Property owners and supporters Ryan and Marianne Larrance will assist, and provide an excavator, and lunch. The project should be complete in April 2025.<br><br>In August of 2024, an RAF grant was awarded to Olympic Field to construct an off-the-grid bathhouse, which was accomplished by the same volunteers who will install the kiosk. The Larrances graciously provide the water source. <br><br>Olympic Airfield lies in the “Lavender Capital of North America,” and has a good turf 2,500-ft long runway, and equally long stretch of water for aircraft on floats. Ballantyne says it offers a secluded place to camp, close to Olympic National Park. “If biking, running, or hiking are your interests, the 126-mile Olympic Discovery Trail follows the Old Seattle &amp; North Coast Railroad grade and can be accessed down the hill from Olympic Field’s campground,” he said.<br><br>For more information and permission contact details, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted February 12, 2025</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by John Priscu, an RAF supporter and a Regents Professor Emeritus at Montana State University, Bozeman.</em></p> <p>Like many in General Aviation, I got the aviation bug in my youth, then spent years raising a family before returning to flight. Growing up in Las Vegas, Nevada, I attended every airshow at Nellis Air Force Base with my father and uncle. My largest thrill was sitting in a USAF Thunderbird F-100. My uncle, a retired WW2 carrier-based aircraft mechanic, remained active in aviation after leaving the Navy and was the live-in manager at the old Boulder City Airport, allowing him to use hangar space to restore aircraft. My first flight was at the age of four roped to my father in the back of his open cockpit PT-19. At the ripe age of 15 my uncle taught me to fly in his Howard DGA-15P during our many visits to dirt strips in the Southwest, including Chicken Strip in the Saline Valley. </p> <p>After leaving Vegas, I eventually ended up in Bozeman, MT, where in 1984 I began a 40-year career at Montana State University. My neighbor taught flying lessons for the Three Forks, MT Flying Club, and at age 50, I got my ticket and eventually bought a Maule, which suited my flying profile to support conservation flying, and fly the backcountry with RAF colleagues.</p> <p>While flying backcountry in Montana and Idaho I met John and Tricia McKenna. We bonded because we liked to camp, mountain bike, and fly, among other things. I became an enduring RAF supporter. My wife, Barbara, and I were looking for a warmer place to live during winter and John and Tricia helped us locate a home in the St. George, UT area, a decision we do not regret. There I met RAF Publicity Liaison Carmine Mowbray; Wayne Loeber (then RAF Utah Liaison); and Gordon Rock (RAF supporter extraordinaire and all-around great guy); we all eventually owned hangars at Hurricane Airport (1L8) and participated in area RAF activities.&nbsp;</p> <p>During one of our mountain biking adventures, John told me about the great biking and flying in Bentonville, Arkansas—I was sold. During the spring of 2024 I planned a flight to Bentonville with a stop in New Mexico. One phone call to John McKenna mentioning my intentions was all it took to get the RAF connections moving. Within days I received emails from RAF NM Liaison Ron Keller and RAF AR Liaison Dave Powell, providing background and support. My plan was to fly to Gallup, NM to visit RAF supporters Perry and Sandra Null, then head to the New Mexico backcountry the next day. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate and Ron informed me that due to rains, the backcountry strips would not be a good place to land and camp. I let Perry know and he offered me hangar space and a place to stay. Perry and Sandra were superb hosts showing me their Perry Null Trading Post (highly recommended). The next morning, I was off to Bentonville where I was met by a welcoming crew organized by Dave Powell. Dave put me up in his hangar and the next day we flew “The OZ” with Dave in my right seat, Chip Gibbons in the lead, and RAF Texas/Montana Ambassador Steve Maus bringing up the rear. Having Dave in the right seat was invaluable because everything was so green that I couldn’t tell a grass strip from a mowed agricultural field. The next day Dave arranged to have a mountain bike delivered to the hangar and he took me on a fantastic ride followed by dinner with his wife Julie, and Steve.</p> <p>After sitting out three days of IFR at Bentonville, I got an MVFR window and departed. After dodging weather through Oklahoma, Texas, and eastern New Mexico, I ended up in Santa Fe, NM for the night. The next morning, I flew direct to 1L8, ending my journey.</p> <p>After returning home, I reflected on the great folks who helped me along the way and the huge role that my RAF connections played. RAF really is a huge family that includes individuals who drop what they are doing in a minute to help a fellow RAF’er.&nbsp;</p> <p>I am honored to be part of the RAF, and am forever indebted to all of the RAF folks for making this flight happen, in addition to all the other RAF efforts preserving great places to land and recreate.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="764" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/JP-Howard_1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17815" style="width:732px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/JP-Howard_1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/JP-Howard_1-300x229.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/JP-Howard_1-768x587.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">John and his uncle (left) following a flight in southern Nevada in his Howard, circa 1971.</figcaption></figure></div> <p><em>John Priscu is a Regents Professor Emeritus at Montana State University, Bozeman.

This 2025 project will continue the upgrade&nbsp;to&nbsp;the original terminal building that serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pilot shelter, meeting room, and kitchen for visitors.&nbsp;The terminal building had&nbsp;fallen into disrepair over several decades.&nbsp;The nonprofit Friends of&nbsp;Lone Pine Airport, (FLPA)&nbsp;saw its cultural, historic, and economic value and in 2022 coordinated with Barilov to help fund materials and organize volunteers to begin restoration.&nbsp;A previous RAF grant&nbsp;helped fund&nbsp;FLPA&nbsp;volunteer efforts to improve&nbsp;the outdoor restrooms, damaged doors, and windows.</p> <p>In addition to the 2025 RAF grant, this project&nbsp;will be&nbsp;funded&nbsp;with&nbsp;a financial contribution from&nbsp;Inyo County, and community project sponsorship program funds, with FLPA volunteers providing labor. They will undertake more extensive restoration of the building, both inside and out. Plans are to complete refinishing of the pilot’s lounge and front office floors, install tongue and groove ceilings, repair and paint interior walls and trim, install floating floors in the kitchen and county office, and install new lighting. The project will also secure the area that houses the AWOS system.</p> <p>Located between the depths of Death Valley National Park and Mount Whitney’s 14,505-ft peak, &#8220;Lone Pine Airport, serves pilots arriving from all over the US and Canada, with many staying for multiple days,” Barilov said. Lone Pine Airport hosts an annual October Backcountry Fly in, which has received national recognition.</p> <p>“Together, we aim to make this airport the aviation gem of the Owens Valley,” Barilov said. The FLPA wrote, “By restoring the terminal building, FLPA will be taking the first step towards making the airport an even more attractive aviation destination, as well as providing substantial benefits to the rural community. We are excited to revitalize this aviation gem.”</p> <p>For more information on Lone Pine Airport, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted January 13, 2025<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

The BLM added language that roads that are designated as “OHV-open” can also be used by aircraft.&nbsp;</p> <p>RAF Utah Liaison and Utah Back Country Pilots board member Wendy Lessig has worked diligently to monitor the BLM planning process, and tirelessly encouraged public comments. “No airstrips were lost or denied in the TMP process and decision.

The RAF is pleased to have our RAF Liaison Wendy Lessig at the forefront of this work.”&nbsp;</p> <p>The San Rafael Decision Record was signed by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Land and Minerals Steven Feldgus and appears&nbsp;<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/1500146/200323703/20125831/251025811/SanRafaelSwellTMP_DR_Final_Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;<strong><em>A table showing the four airstrips appears on page 558.&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p><em>Submitted January 9, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Andrew George, the President of the Idaho Aviation Association.</em></p> <p>When I spoke at the 2024 RAF Volunteer Education Conference in Montana, I emphasized to those in attendance that we face one overarching challenge and one true adversary that poses the greatest threat to our industry: <strong>public opinion.</strong> I have not wavered in this belief.</p> <p>As aviators, we are a minority voice navigating within a majority of opinions that often shape policies. These policies, in turn, have the potential to restrict our rights to explore the skies. While we can discuss wilderness access issues, the complexities of the air traffic control system, or even the nuances of proper etiquette and behavior, none of these concerns carries the weight of what a negative public perception can do.</p> <p>Aviation has long battled the stigma of being unsafe or corrupt and careless at times—an image that does not reflect reality. Every industry has its bad actors, but aviation suffers disproportionately because its rare missteps are often catastrophic and widely publicized. Tragedies overshadow human-interest stories, creating lasting impressions that are hard to reverse.</p> <p>Consider the devastating events at Reno, when the <em>Galloping Ghost</em> experienced a minor mechanical failure that led to significant loss of life and indelible memories for millions. That singular event reshaped how the Reno Air Races operated and began to erode public support, contributing to the eventual decline of the races at Stead Field.</p> <p>This delicate balance between public perception and our freedoms is not unique to Reno—it applies across the country. One incident is all it takes to shift public sentiment in a way that permanently alters our ability to enjoy the skies.</p> <p>I see the RAF as a vital force in combating these perceptions. The organization is uniquely positioned to share positive, corrective information about aviation’s benefits. Unlike larger national organizations like AOPA or EAA, which focus on broad industry-wide concerns or specific passions like building and flying experimental aircraft, the RAF’s grassroots approach is tailored to the needs and culture exemplified within individual states.</p> <p>Aviation adapts to the physical and cultural geography of each region. The RAF excels by fostering a flow of information from local communities to a central hub and then redistributing it widely. The RIF RAF newsletters are great communicators of regional activities and contributions. This creates a system where local knowledge and stories can shape public opinion far beyond where they originated. The RIF RAF has shown where the Congressional information is shared as well. A benefit to its commitment to work with the Federal agencies throughout.</p> <p>Because the RAF operates at the airfield level —where its contacts understand the specific needs of local pilots—it is uniquely effective in shaping country wide public perception. By focusing on grassroots engagement, the RAF has already made significant strides in influencing public opinion in many areas, with even greater potential in the future.</p> <p>To maintain and grow this influence, we must all participate. It takes consistent communication—sharing information, correcting misconceptions, and engaging those who may view aviation as reckless or uncaring. Changing minds requires effort from all of us, not just within our local communities but also in collaboration with those far removed from our own neighborhoods.</p> <p>We are always one bad day away from a shift in public opinion. While this is the reality of the social environment we live in, the degree of that shift depends on what we do today—how we communicate, how we collaborate, and how we behave as ambassadors of aviation.</p> <p>We will all share in the struggles to protect our rights as aviators while we also create new ways to ensure our behaviors are safe and perceived as positive. The RAF is poised to be one of the few, deliberate organizations that I see as being in the right place at the right time. The RAF is not the AOPA in size and doesn’t need to be. It is not the EAA and has a singular focus. It is not like the IAA either as we are specific to our geographical areas. The RAF, oh it is sitting pretty in my mind…it has the beauty of being large enough to command a seat at the table, small enough to know where it came from yet powerful enough to add strength to any argument it sees fit. That’s where the RAF provides such assistance to help create a stream of information back and for that will and has shaped positive public opinion.</p> <p>Let this serve as a reminder: Every day, the IAA (or other organizations) seeks ways to share, communicate, and collaborate—not just locally but across the nation. I strongly support the RAF’s mission and its ability to share our passion for aviation, connecting my community to yours and fostering understanding and appreciation for what we all love.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:36% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="988" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6137-1-1-988x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17618 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6137-1-1-988x1024.jpeg 988w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6137-1-1-289x300.jpeg 289w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6137-1-1-768x796.jpeg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_6137-1-1.jpeg 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Andrew is a Multi Instrument Commercial Pilot with close to 3000 hours who started flying the Idaho Backcountry after learning to fly in the year 2000.

Originally inked in 2008 and renewed in 2017, this Memorandum of Understanding between the NPS and the RAF authorizes RAF volunteers to perform mutually beneficial repairs to park airstrips at no cost to the United States. This Volunteer In the Parks, or “VIP” agreement marked the first such compact between the NPS and a pilot organization, a major step toward ensuring aircraft’s very low impact form of access to the park.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement authorizes the RAF to organize volunteers to help maintain the airstrips for Park and public use, with the RAF represented by RAF President Bill McGlynn, and Park Superintendent Mike Reynolds for the NPS. CA Liaison Katerina Barilov is identified as a key official on the agreement, and will help ensure effective communication between the RAF and NPS.</p> <p>“The RAF and the NPS have been successfully partnering for nearly sixteen years to make access to these areas safe and available to the aviation community,” RAF Board Chairman John McKenna said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF cooperates with pilot associations and groups from the surrounding areas to provide project labor and funds. The NPS provides a drag device for the gravel airstrip in the Saline&nbsp;Valley&nbsp;called Chicken Strip, and volunteers routinely provide hand labor to restore the runway surface after seasonal washouts, according to RAF California Liaison Rick Lach. Volunteers are mustered to provide invasive weed removal and other grounds maintenance at the Park’s other airstrips, Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek.</p> <p>“The RAF is proud of our successful relationship with the Park Service in&nbsp;Death&nbsp;Valley&nbsp;and we look forward to continuing our cooperation. We value the trust the Park Service has placed in us by renewing our agreement,” McGlynn said.</p> <p><em>Submitted December 18, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

The entire Arkansas staff had signed it, and Roger had penned the following message that we want to share with you:</p> <p>“RAF is such an important org and we are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">so very lucky</span>&nbsp;for both your partnership &amp; friendship! Thanks for all you’re doing in Arkansas . . . and across the entire nation! Happy Holidays, Always, Roger.”</p> <p>“The&nbsp;Arkansas TNC/RAF relationship is one we at the RAF appreciate,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said. “This note we received makes me very happy, as well as proud.”</p> <p>John Nadeau of Massachusetts, one of the RAF’s first liaisons, had initiated dialog with The Nature Conservancy. Nadeau was well versed in state recreational liability laws and was able to provide information&nbsp;about public use of privately owned airfields. Arkansas Liaison Harper Goodwin already had a good neighbor relationship with TNC since his property is surrounded on three sides by TNC land. He and Powell approached TNC about creating an airfield above the Kings River. The Trigger Gap airfield and pavilion were built by RAF and Fly Oz volunteers and has become a well-loved airplane camping destination. Local volunteers stock firewood, and maintain the camping area. Powell says, “We have a real community that cares, and respects what TNC has given us.”</p> <p>After the successful completion of Trigger Gap, the RAF turned its attention to a TNC-owned airfield in Maine along the St. John’s River, and eventually signed a lease for continued access to Red Pine airport. Since then, volunteers have continued making improvements to camping amenities. “The relationship in Arkansas really helped us get this done here in Maine,” RAF Maine Liaison Andy Rowe pointed out, adding, “It has been&nbsp;a great pleasure working with the world’s largest private conservation organization for the last decade! Opening up Red Pine for more access with lower impact should benefit both TNC and recreational aviation for decades.”</p> <p>Powell puts it this way. “Relationships are so important, and ours is excellent. We continually ask TNC what we can do for them. We’ve taken them for flights to survey potential lands to acquire by air. They invite us on river trips. We’re like family.”</p> <p><em>Submitted December 23, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Charlie Gregoire, the President/COO of Redbird Flight Simulations and an RAF Volunteer.</em></p> <p>A few months ago, Clay Simmons wrote a Guest Editorial that I thought hit the nail on the head.&nbsp;If you missed it, I highly recommend that you <a href="https://theraf.org/worth-the-read-clay-simmons-guest-editorial/">read it now</a>.&nbsp;Clay’s passion for aviation and his desire to provide others with the opportunity to join in this unique experience comes across very clearly. For me, reading it was a powerful reminder to not get so blinded by the “what” that you lose sight of the “why.” Simon Sinek would be proud.</p> <p>So why do we do the things we do?&nbsp;That&#8217;s a broad and contemplative question that has kept behavioral psychologists, theologians and parents of toddlers scratching their heads since the dawn of time.&nbsp;I&#8217;m a naturally inquisitive person but this particular existential enigma is not one that I am qualified to opine on, so perhaps I should be more specific.&nbsp;Why do we, as proud supporters and volunteers of the RAF, do the things that we do in the name of the organization?&nbsp;While everyone’s personal motivations are unique, I feel confident in broadly asserting that for most, if not all of us, it comes down to one word.&nbsp;Community.</p> <p>The RAF&#8217;s official mission statement says that it &#8220;&#8230;preserves, improves, and creates airstrips for recreational access.&#8221;&nbsp;That’s a very concise summation of the “what” but it doesn’t address the “why.” It’s easy to conflate those two things but they’re not the same.&nbsp;When British mountaineer George Mallory was asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, he famously responded “because it’s there.” Mallory’s response illustrates a uniquely human desire to face a seemingly insurmountable challenge head on for no other purpose than to say that we could.&nbsp;Can the same be said about the work we do?&nbsp;Do we clear trees and mow grass just because it’s there to be cleared and mowed?&nbsp;Do we lobby bureaucrats because they are there to be lobbied? Of course not.</p> <p>The RAF doesn&#8217;t preserve, improve and create airstrips just because they are there. We preserve them, we improve them, we create them in the earnest hopes that they will serve as gathering points, community hubs around which we can create shared experiences with those we love, and those we have yet to meet.&nbsp;Whether you&#8217;re a part of a group of pilots looking for a challenging and unique aviation experience, or you’re a loner in search of the most remote area of the world to contemplate the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, we hope these special places that we toil over will provide for you.</p> <p>It’s easy to think of the RAF as a steward of airstrips and while that’s true, it’s not the whole truth.&nbsp;Maintaining strips would be pointless if no one used them. So to be more complete we must also think of the RAF as a steward of the community it has inherited and participates in.&nbsp;Gathering, strengthening, encouraging a community of aviators is now and always has been at the heart of why we do what we do. It’s why I have and will continue to proudly support this fantastic foundation.</p> <p>Recreational aviation didn’t start with us and as long as we continue to behave as true stewards, it won’t end with us.&nbsp;We must continue to carry on with our mission, to preserve, improve, and create airstrips and aviators.&nbsp;It’s our responsibility to ensure that these experiences we enjoy so completely are available and accessible to the pilots who come after us. In addition to ensuring access to strips, this means we must arm those pilots with the necessary tools, resources and training so that they may find and enjoy them safely.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course all this is just my opinion, but that&#8217;s what you get when you read a guest editorial.&nbsp;Do you disagree?&nbsp;Let me know in the comments below.&nbsp;I welcome open and honest conversation. That is, after all, the best way to build community.</p> <p>P.S. If you are the aforementioned loner, the answer of course is 42. For the question…I’ll leave that to Douglas Adams to explain.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:40% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Charlie-Gregoire.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17566 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Charlie-Gregoire.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Charlie-Gregoire-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Charlie-Gregoire-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Charlie Gregoire is co-founder of Redbird Flight Simulations and currently serves as its President and Chief Operating Officer.

The US Forest Service manages the majority of these areas, followed by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and US Fish and Wildlife Service. There are even more Wilderness Study Areas, (WSAs) with wilderness characteristics that make them eligible for designation as Wilderness. The BLM alone has 487 WSAs.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Wilderness Act of 1964&nbsp;defines these areas as “where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man. . .” They are managed with the government’s highest level of land protection and are non-motorized areas. Aircraft are an exception to the non-motorized rule, as continued public use of aircraft was granted for airfields that existed prior to the Wilderness Act being enacted.</p> <p>In the interest of preserving aviation access to these special places, the RAF Backcountry Etiquette Team (BET) has engaged in outreach and education. Lynn Mareth, chair of the RAF BET points out, “The Wilderness Act of 1964 permits the use of aircraft in wilderness areas already established, but the Secretary of Agriculture can restrict access at any time.” Her concern is supported by the official record. The four federal agencies have publicized that they are moving toward implementing what they formally define as Wilderness Character, the path toward more restrictive Wilderness management.</p> <p>Knowing where Wilderness is, and practicing good backcountry etiquette helps ensure continued access. Your chart marks Wilderness Areas with solid/dotted blue lines, and they look similar to National Recreation Areas, but the name of the Wilderness will be within the border.&nbsp;This marking does not appear on the chart legend.</p> <p>In these areas, it is important to practice Leave No Trace, and, when safe to do so, minimize your noise signature, as others in the vicinity seek quiet surroundings. And of course, land and stay a while, to fully enjoy the special qualities Wilderness areas have to offer.</p> <p>For more suggestions, see the RAF&nbsp;<a href="https://theraf.org/education-safety/#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on December 11, 2024.</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

He invited folks from the region to fly in with hand tools during the November 23-24 weekend to remove encroaching vegetation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eleven aircraft arrived, bringing 14 folks, mainly from Arizona; one from California and one from Colorado. Earning longest-distance honors was RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller, who put in a good day’s work after his three-and-a-half hour flight from south of Albuquerque.&nbsp;</p> <p>Volunteers went to work on the bunchgrass, and brought the 3,000-ft north-south airstrip back to a condition suitable for most GA recreational aircraft. Null treated everyone to fresh hot breakfast burritos and&nbsp;provided&nbsp;water. Carmine Mowbray dropped in from southern Utah with firewood and water for the crew. Several visitors hiked down and toured the remains of the Grand Gulch Copper Mining Company, an enterprise that operated over a 90-year period. During World War I and the electrification copper boom, as many as 80 employees lived on site, working for a dollar a day and the promise of raisin pie for dessert.</p> <p>Five aircraft remained overnight and visitors enjoyed sunset over the Grand Wash Cliffs and dark skies surrounding the Grand Canyon-Parashant Monument mesa.</p> <p>Null invites pilots to enjoy this backcountry strip, its scenic vistas, stargazing, and a walk through some fascinating history just a short hike to the mine. It’s dry, primitive camping,&nbsp;and&nbsp;visitors will appreciate the new ADA vault toilet near the windsock, provided and installed by the BLM.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted November 27, 2024.</em></p> ]]>

Again this October, volunteers from the RAF, Idaho Aviation Association, (IAA) and the Selway Bitterroot Frank Church Foundation cooperated with the Forest Service to complete the fencing project. Because Moose Creek lies in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, only primitive tools are allowed, so the fence materials had been pre-drilled prior to being airlifted in.</p> <p>To minimize hauling traffic, the Forest Service used their Sherpa to deliver the long fence poles; and the RAF enlisted skilled backcountry pilots Robert Miller and Rob Wells who volunteered their time to haul materials in with the Kodiak 100 provided to the RAF for backcountry use by Daher. The tall piles of posts and poles soon disappeared one-by-one over the shoulders of volunteers along the little flags marking the long fence perimeters. Small groups of volunteers connected the posts and poles with a few hammer strokes, and the fence lines eventually met up to complete the needed corrals and grazing area.</p> <p>The recent fire had destroyed both camp area outhouses, so Dave Irvin, IAA’s North-central Idaho District Director, and Craig Thomas of the Stevensville (Montana) Airport Foundation designed and pre-fabricated two new structures. All power tool work was done at Stevensville, and the components were designed to fit in the Kodiak. Miller hauled them in, and volunteers assembled them with traditional tools. “This fall, campers, hunters and anglers now have two functioning outhouses and the Forest Service doesn&#8217;t have to worry about environmental impact issues of the campground,” RAF President and project organizer Bill McGlynn said.</p> <p>The fire and winds had caused extensive damage to the area around the ranger station, and volunteers helped clear fallen trees and debris. Volunteer cooks Fred Hebert and Alex Cravener from Boise prepared sunrise coffee and all meals.</p> <p>“The big story is the collaboration amongst the IAA, the Stevensville pilots, their Airport Foundation, the Selway Bitterroot Frank Church Foundation, and the RAF. The commitment of the volunteers was in the truest sense of selflessly giving back hard work to a place that has given great joy to so many. Everyone there had a great sense of satisfaction that they had done a good thing, with minimum impact,” McGlynn added.</p> <p>Submitted on October 23, 2024<br></p> ]]>

We would like to formalize these kinds of agreements with every Forest in the System,” McGlynn added, giving a nod to RAF Arizona Liaison Mark Spencer, and New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller for their exemplary cooperation and work with their regional Forest Service personnel.</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 28, 2024</em><br><em>by Carmine Mowbray.</em></p> ]]>

District Ranger Frank Aebly and Forestry Technician Mark Sampson represented the Forest Service, helped haul water and cement, and transported supplies to the strip.</p> <p>Cossitt said, “This airstrip is a gem due to the area’s physical beauty, and the large Tule elk herd that frequents the area. September is peak rut season, a wonderful reason to use the airstrip.” He reports that work party participants who spent the night heard some bugling from rutting elk. “The Forest Service is very supportive of the airstrip and sees it as a key resource in future recreation plans,” Cossitt added.</p> <p>That support was especially evident at the October 19 event. Aebly and his team had to get NEPA approval, organize clearing brush and digging of the windsock hole, purchase all the needed equipment and parts, and fabricate the windsock pole and mount.</p> <p>&#8220;The Forest Service invested a substantial amount of time and money into improving the airstrip, and the RAF appreciates their support,” Cossitt said.</p> <p>The 3500-ft runway surface is rough but still usable. The USFS hopes to drag the runway soon but is still determining when this will occur.</p> <p>To delve deeper into the history and features of Gravelly Valley, we recommend exploring the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/361ffde5-7f35-4fc3-a7b8-d34c1d67688c/overview?searchQuery=gravelly+v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>&nbsp;for a comprehensive overview.</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 28, 2024.</em></p> ]]>

The plan to shift the runway surface laterally within the clearing is underway, so the current runway surface can recover from use.</p> <p>Schafer Meadows lies within the Great Bear Wilderness with no road access, and where no motorized tools are allowed. Delivery of the bulky equipment needed to be accomplished with aircraft, and&nbsp;required significant advance planning and several deliveries, due to the size of the equipment. Newpower was aided by Montana Aeronautics Administrator and pilots Tim Conway, and Aviation Support Officer Stephen Torske. The Forest Service was represented by Jeremy Rust who is leading the project. Teamsters&nbsp;Boone Jones from Stevensville and Lonnie Metzger from Ronan drove a hitch of three horses to plow the surface, bringing to mind a scene from the 19th century.</p> <p>A team of mules – in part provided by an RAF grant – typically does ground preparation work at Schafer, but only these horses were available at the time the plowing needed to be done. The two drovers were caught on video bumping along making good time, as Newpower observed, “The horses’ default speed is a trot which is way too fast.”&nbsp;With some patience from these experienced drovers, the runway was plowed safely and in keeping with the spirit of the Wilderness.</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 28, 2024.</em></p> ]]>

RAF South Dakota Liaison Karl Jungclaus reported that the financial burden would have been placed upon the Park. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks (SDGFP) determined closing the airport was the best option.&nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF, South Dakota Pilots Association (SDPA), Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) and other groups and individuals all endeavored to raise public awareness, and provide supportive reasons to preserve the airport.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leadership from SDGFP was receptive to pilots’ opinions,&nbsp;but continued with their plan to close the existing airport.&nbsp;They considered complex factors including financial, public opinion, natural environment and habitat before making the decision to close the airport.</p> <p>In June 2024, a video conference was conducted between the RAF and SDGFP leadership. The idea of an alternative site within the park to operate aircraft was determined to be worthy of investigation.&nbsp;Custer State Park staff searched for suitable locations. “Unfortunately, the staff felt that no suitable locations were available due to complicated topography, boulders, prairie dog holes, power lines, bison travel corridors and the obligation for the park to protect its population of endangered Black Footed Ferrets,” Jungclaus reported.</p> <p>“While this is certainly a&nbsp;disappointment and ends an era of aircraft operations within Custer State Park, a solid and respectful relationship was started between SD&nbsp;Game, Fish and Parks leadership and multiple aviation interest groups including RAF, SDPA, and AOPA; along with multiple like-minded groups and individuals,” Jungclaus said. Not one to be deterred in carrying out the RAF mission, Jungclaus added,&nbsp; “We hope to explore other public land opportunities within South Dakota where recreational aviation could thrive.”&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on November 7, 2024.</em></p> ]]>

The scenic and remote airstrip had suffered significant flood damage, and the BLM environmental review to perform more extensive repairs would have taken months to complete. To return the landing surface to usable condition, these volunteers had to observe Wilderness rules and carry their hand tools, food, and water five miles round trip to the strip. They worked multiple days, camping in temperatures that dropped to 20 degrees overnight.</p> <p>“Because of the restrictions on wheeled conveyances in Wilderness Areas, the Sled Dogs earned their name pulling plastic toboggans full of dirt to even out the runway surface,” Evans explained. RAF Utah Liaison Wendy Lessig acted as home base coordinator for communications for the work party. “Credit goes to UBCP for the planning and execution of this effort,” Lessig said, adding, “They made sure that Leave No Trace and proper care for the wilderness area was followed.”</p> <p>Evans shared this story, “about what&#8217;s possible when a small group such as the UBCP Sled Dogs puts their minds and hearts together on a project,” on the UBCP website. <a href="https://utahbackcountrypilots.org/sleddogs">See the remarkable story and before and after photos here.</a><br><br>For nearly three decades, UBCP volunteers have dedicated themselves to stewardship and ethical use of Utah&#8217;s over 200 backcountry airstrips as an important part of their mission. Currently, the organization is nearly 500 members strong. See <a href="https://utahbackcountrypilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utah Back Country Pilots Association</a> for more information.</p> <p>The RAF deeply appreciates UBCP’s longtime efforts to preserve and protect the unique and spectacular backcountry airstrips in Utah.</p> <p><em>Submitted November 15, 2024.</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Peyton Arndt, a pilot and volunteer for the RAF&#8217;s Social Media Team.</em></p> <p>As I delve deeper into the world of aviation, I realize just how unique my introduction to flight has been. Unlike many, I didn’t grow up with my eyes fixed on the sky or obsessing over airplanes. It wasn’t until my early 20’s that I even discovered the world of general aviation. However, my childhood was spent immersed in the outdoors with a love for adventure and exploration, which laid the perfect foundation for what would come later – my introduction to the RAF.</p> <p>My path to aviation was anything but straightforward. It was long, bumpy, and filled with unexpected turns, but nonetheless it’s brought me here today. Life is full of choices and moments that alter our course, shaping us in ways we can never anticipate. For me, that defining moment came in the remote wilderness of Canada, where a boating accident left me with a traumatic T10 spinal cord injury. In a single, life-shattering instant, everything changed.</p> <p>I was suddenly at the edge of a life I could no longer recognize, grieving the future I had always imagined. But in the midst of that devastation, I made a choice – to pick up the cards that life had dealt me and play them with everything I had. My recovery led me down unexpected roads, introducing me to people and experiences I never would have otherwise crossed paths with. One of those first encounters was with a pilot who owned an airplane back in my hometown, a meeting that would become a pivotal turning point.</p> <p>What began as an escape – flying to feel free from the weight of the world on the ground – quickly transformed into something much more profound. Becoming PIC didn’t just give me command of a machine that defied gravity – it reignited a belief in myself to take back control of my own life. The privilege of flight helped me find the courage I once knew that had been hiding out beneath the surface. Although, none of it was easy. I quickly concluded that there was no fixed path for individuals like me, I’d have to carve out my own.</p> <p>As time turned aviation into a passion, along came the RAF, seamlessly weaving together the different chapters of my life. The organization felt like a rare haven – one where goodness, camaraderie, and purpose still thrived in this world. I immediately felt a deep sense of connection and community within the world of aviation.</p> <p>With that sense of connection came a deep desire to give back. Aviation had been an unexpected gift in my life, and I’m determined to pay it forward. I’ve started by volunteering my time and marketing skills but aspire to do more. As someone once told me, “One day I would tell my story – how I overcame everything I went through – and it would serve as someone else’s survival guide.” So, that’s exactly what I’ve set out to do.</p> <p>It has become my personal mission to advocate for those who dream of flying but are uncertain about the unique path it will take to get there. Whether by sharing my own struggles and triumphs or by being a voice for the Able Flight scholarship that gave me the chance to earn my pilot’s license, I am dedicated to making aviation accessible for all. With MOSAIC on the verge of transforming the one-size-fits-all approach to conventional FAA certifications, the opportunities for sport pilots are expanding like never before. I want to show others how they too can build an adapted airplane to fit their needs and achieve what once seemed impossible.</p> <p>People often say, “The sky is the limit,” but I believe the sky should have no limits. The freedom to soar into remote backcountry places—the heart of the RAF’s mission—should be within reach for anyone bold enough to dream it. It’s the boundless sense of possibility that I hope to share with others, inspiring them to chase their own skies, no matter the adversity.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="798" height="642" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/First-Solo-at-Purdue-University-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17350" style="width:650px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/First-Solo-at-Purdue-University-1-1.jpg 798w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/First-Solo-at-Purdue-University-1-1-300x241.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/First-Solo-at-Purdue-University-1-1-768x618.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Peyton&#8217;s First Solo at Purdue University</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:51% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Peyton-Wolter-Bio-Photo-resized.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14442 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Peyton-Wolter-Bio-Photo-resized.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Peyton-Wolter-Bio-Photo-resized-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Peyton-Wolter-Bio-Photo-resized-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Peyton, a Wisconsin native, grew up with a passion for adventure and fully embraces an active, outdoor lifestyle.

That work was completed as part of a greater rejuvenation effort by FLPA.</p> <p>Anna Montgomery of FLPA reported that in May of this year, the group tackled restoring the airport terminal building.&nbsp;“Volunteers began the much needed job of scraping, sanding, patching and caulking.&nbsp;Over one hundred man hours were put into building prep, followed by a coat of primer,” she said.&nbsp;Pocked and cloudy window glass was replaced.&nbsp;She said the September 14-15 weekend “brought an energetic crew both days,” who applied two coats of light grey paint to the building, trimmed with dark grey.&nbsp;Two new exterior doors will be installed, and, ”We are excited about a custom metal sign for the roof, incorporating the Mount Whitney skyline in its design,”&nbsp;Montgomery said.&nbsp;“Following the completion of the exterior, we will move on to restoring the pilot&#8217;s lounge,” she added.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="855" data-id="17325" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4402.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17325" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4402.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4402-300x257.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4402-768x657.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lone Pine Airport when FLPA was started</figcaption></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" data-id="17322" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image7.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17322" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image7.jpeg 640w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image7-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p>Lone Pine has a long and significant aviation history.

Owners of Patterson Island airfield, G21 have already invested a huge effort reclaiming this overgrown 2,000-foot long runway that hadn’t been used in over a decade, “and have made it look like a fairway,” RAF Georgia Liaison Kevin Barry reports.</p> <p>To finish making the field safe to land, Barry assessed the need to cut back encroaching oak limbs along a third of the runway. He determined the best course was to hire a professional tree removal service, then round up volunteers to arrive on the island and chop and remove the resulting wood waste. Owners Ken and Kellie Day provided use of their ferry. Volunteers successfully conducted the clean up in mid-September, however damage from September’s Hurricane Helene will require additional effort. A future work party is planned to clean things back up. “The goal is to have the runway open as soon as possible,” Barry said. </p> <p>“Patterson Island is a gateway airfield to this pristine, remote and beautiful part of the Georgia coast,” Barry says. Statistics show that nearby Creighton Island is the third most reviewed listing in the Airfield Guide proving its popularity with recreational pilots. The improvements at Patterson Island will increase the ability to access the many recreational opportunities in the area. Jekyll and St. Simon Islands are immediately to the east and offer beaches, bicycle rentals, lodging, golf, and popular restaurants. Cumberland Island, to the south, is a state park with pristine beaches, wild horses, hiking, and historical structures. Patterson Island owners will allow camping, hiking, fishing, boating, and swimming. Local fishing charter service is available as well. </p> <p>Stay tuned for more information on the opening of Patterson Island.</p> <p><em>Posted September 30, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

He and a few other volunteers flew in and camped in advance of this year’s event to help mow the airfield, measure the runway and mark the thresholds temporarily until they installed the permanent markings. They cut firewood for the RAF fire ring, and arranged tables for the event.&nbsp;“The Northern Lights were pretty spectacular that evening, which is a very rare event in Southern Illinois,”&nbsp;Warner said.</p> <p>More planes arrived Friday and by nightfall ten planes from three states including a restored Pietenpol Air Camper had settled in for some stargazing. The AASI set up telescopes and a high tech imaging device, “and they seemed thrilled with the dark sky, in spite of the half moon. We took turns between the telescopes and the fire,” Warner said. Local historian Mark Motsinger regaled folks on Southern Illinois history and why it is so different from most of the state.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warner estimates that over 50 people attended, some of whom also enjoyed hiking or fishing. “All in all it was a success, and folks are already talking about next year and what the RAF is doing,” Warner added.</p> <p>For more information on Henderson Field and the required safety briefing, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/fabc7510-28a8-4f29-a8ce-7dbf8d5d32ea/overview?searchQuery=95IL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted October 15, 2024</em></p> ]]>

Lessig explains that BLM categorizes this land as “Limited” or “Closed.” Limited means that all OHVs, including aircraft, must stay on roads, trails, and airstrips that are “designated routes” and specifically listed in the BLM TMP for that area. “Closed” areas include wilderness and other areas where OHVs are prohibited.</p> <p>The remaining 15 airstrips have not undergone a cultural evaluation for possible inclusion in the future. ”This outcome is exactly what we hoped for and expected,” Lessig said. She has worked diligently following the planning process and submitting substantive comments, and said, “The Henry Mountains TMP is one of thirteen TMPs that the BLM is under a court-ordered deadline to review and reissue due to a lawsuit settlement agreement with an environmental group. ”</p> <p>Acording to Lessig, these are the airstrips in the Henry Mountains travel management area that are on designated routes:<br>Angel Point<br>Big Thompson Mesa<br>Cave Flat (may have seasonal use restrictions)<br>Eagle Benches North<br>Eagle City (South) Airstrip<br>Gold Creek / Shootering<br>Middle Canyon<br>Nielson Wash<br>Point of Rocks<br>Road Junction 95-276<br>Robbers Roost / Little Y Airstrip<br>Sams Mesa<br>Simplot /Funky Airstrip<br>Starr Spring<br>Twin Corral Flats West</p> <p>RAF supporters can click on this <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/94098/510">ePlanning link</a> to read the draft TMP. “If they want to submit comments, they can thank the BLM for including the 15 airstrips in the draft TMP and that we strongly support adding the other 15 airstrips to the TMP later,” Lessig advised.</p> <p><em>Submitted October 15, 2024.</em></p> ]]>

Funded in great part by an RAF grant secured by RAF Montana Liaison Scott Newpower, the total cost of the 16 x 24-ft structure, including its central fire ring was $12,764. “It’s a flagship model timber frame economy pavilion,” Kuefler said. “And this design could be used elsewhere.” Local contractor Sam Cates Construction provided the equivalent of $3,000 in labor and equipment; and Bailey’s Dirt Works did the excavating and provided labor and material to anchor the posts. </p> <p>St. Ignatius is not an FAA-designated field. The community wholeheartedly supports its airport, and volunteers stage an annual pancake breakfast that typically hosts over 500 folks. $500 in profits from that Mission Airport fund were provided for the project, another $500 from the sale of Ben Ryan’s Fisher Classic bi-plane; and Kuefler and Airport Manager Rick Newman rounded up $500 from both Montana Pilots Association and Brett Thoft Memorial Foundation toward the project.</p> <p>The structure is based on the design used at the West Yellowstone airport campground, and is located near the existing pilot lobby, outhouse, and water hydrant. Tie-downs near the pavilion accommodate underwing camping. Stutzman’s Country Market is just over the airport fence. The paved airport has fuel and a courtesy car, making it a convenient staging point to explore Montana’s Bob Marshall Wilderness, and Idaho’s Frank Church and Selway Wilderness.</p> <p>“This airport is great for people who prefer pavement but want to be near mountains to get the flavor and feel of the backcountry,” Newpower said.&nbsp;</p> <p>For information on St. Ignatius, 52S, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/4c4c1592-0764-442f-9312-d14e58641a09/overview?searchQuery=52S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted September 30, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

His avid support stemmed from Daher Kodiak’s cordial relationship with the RAF, kindled in 2022.</p> <p>RAF Director and General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) Chairman Pete Bunce included the RAF in GAMA events, where the relationship began with pilot and aircraft-innovator Chabbert. When Daher acquired Quest &#8211; Kodiak in 2019, Chabbert was introduced to the backcountry capabilities of the Kodiak. In 2022, having learned that some active backcountry airstrips are located in Wilderness Areas with no access roads, he approached the RAF with an offer to loan one of the Sandpoint, ID-based corporate Kodiaks to help complete RAF missions in Idaho and Montana.</p> <p>“In 2023, we used the donated Kodiak to move an AmeriCorps trail crew from Missoula into Moose Creek Forest Service airstrip to work on the runways; then later that fall, transported fence material and volunteers in to replace jackleg fence around the ranger station to contain their pack animals; and moved several loads of shingles to the Shearer Airstrip for the guard station there,” RAF President Bill McGlynn explained.</p> <p>By then, Chabbert had arranged for his company to take a new Kodiak 100 and prominently brand it with RAF colors, both for hardy use in the backcountry, and display at Daher Kodiak’s AirVenture scene.</p> <p>In October 2024, the RAF is using the Kodiak to airlift material, supplies and people into Moose Creek to replace the two outhouses that burned in the recent forest fire; and complete the fence project.</p> <p>“Because the Kodiak is such a capable backcountry aircraft – hauling ten people at a time, or 248 cubic feet of cargo, it&#8217;s a game-changer for accomplishing significant missions for the RAF,” McGlynn said, adding, “We can&#8217;t thank Daher enough for their wonderful support of backcountry aviation by way of this gift to the RAF.”</p> <p>RAF Chairman John McKenna said, “A relationship with a company like Daher Kodiak is a real plus to the RAF. You are judged by the company you keep, and who could ask for better company?”</p> <p><em>Submitted September 30, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Carmine Mowbray, a pilot and the RAF&#8217;s Publicity Liaison.</em></p> </div></div> <p></p> <p>When the owner of the local FBO ordered fancy printing from our little Montana print shop and couldn’t pay his bill, he agreed to teach my husband and me how to get an airplane in the sky and back on the ground safely. We decided to buy an airplane and the CFI located a 1957 150-hp TriPacer. I was so ignorant, I was expecting a tri-motor. When 6928-Delta puttered in off the runway, I fell in love with our simple fabric, tricycle gear four-seat single.</p> <p>It was paper chart, watch, and E6B days. You planned cross-county flights by penciling in your waypoints. Being surrounded by mountains, our CFI was a stickler about slow flight and preached, “Every landing is a short-field landing!” Training I appreciate today.</p> <p>Near Montana’s Continental Divide, winters are cold but pretty clear. We could fly nearly all year. Avgas was 57¢ a gallon, and our banker let us park in his old hangar for free. As some do, we coveted that ever-faster, sleeker aircraft, and eventually owned and flew retractables, then a 300-hp Turbo T-Tail Lance for 16 years. It was great for business and long cross-countries with the four kids. But I felt the best way to see the West was around a hundred knots, a few hundred feet over the high ground. Where you see spray off a waterfall; mountain goats trekking the ledges; a small herd of elk grazing, or the circular ripples surrounding a moose in a pond. My heart was always back at places like Meadow Creek beneath the massive limestone terraces, where we had spent a soggy three-day Memorial Day weekend in a pup tent waiting for the rain to stop. “If this is so miserable, why am I enjoying it so much?” I’d asked myself.</p> <p>RAF co-founder Chuck Jarecki stopped often at my Polson home for coffee and to share flying stories. He flew me to a few Montana work parties where I joined upbeat volunteers. Whether it was chopping sagebrush, clearing encroaching trees, throwing rocks, digging postholes or privy holes, we had fun. We were making something better.</p> <p>Chuck asked me to edit some early letters and informational materials even before the quaint RAF logo showed up. Way back when John McKenna had a mustache. I sent a few dollars in to HQ. An orange shirt arrived in my mailbox with a handwritten thank you. The custom of writing handwritten notes, by the way, has continued throughout the RAF&#8217;s 22 years. More work parties, an organizational workshop, a few lengthy public lands meetings, and passionate folks started showing up in their orange shirts, all giving their time to support the preservation of backcountry aviation, and I found inspiration.</p> <p>Now with the ideal aircraft for my purposes, an old 182 with the Sportsman STOL, pursuing that inspiration is up to me, my skills, and sound PIC judgment. And thanks to the RAF and its partners, there are plenty of beautiful places to go. There are disappointments when the weather or summer wildfire smoke shuts out a destination, but a constant is always the fine folks who share the mission.</p> <p>The RAF has added purpose to my flying. I’ve made lifetime friends, and seen places I’d have missed if not for the RAF and its successes. It feels good to leave a place better than you found it, and know that these special places will endure for others to enjoy.</p> <p>Often folks refer to the RAF mission as a cross-country flight, a journey from Point A to B. But I see it more as an orbit, since it should have no end. I see a long and productive future for the RAF. The RAF is constantly in motion, but remains close enough to Earth to recognize its beauty and preserve our special way to access it.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:51% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="981" height="960" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CM-at-Sullivan-t.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17252 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CM-at-Sullivan-t.jpeg 981w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CM-at-Sullivan-t-300x294.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CM-at-Sullivan-t-768x752.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Carmine married and moved to Montana at age 19.

Mike Ginter, former AOPA VP of Airports and Advocacy emceed. Ginter has recently taken on the position of Senior VP of the Air Safety Institute. &nbsp;</p> <p>Ginter led the discussion by announcing that the Congressional FAA Reauthorization bill passed, resulting in “a bigger pie than before, and GA has a larger piece,” amounting to $1 billion of the $4 billion total fund that prioritizes aviation safety, consumer protections, grows the aviation safety workforce, advances technology and innovation, and modernizes&nbsp;the&nbsp;national airspace system.&nbsp;</p> <p>RAF liaisons and ambassadors are invited to communicate with their Regional Manager, who monitors and advocates on issues critical to General Aviation. These seven professionals are registered lobbyists, and are GA’s advocates in Congress and state legislatures. Top priorities include preserving public-use airports facing closure, and preventing airspace encroachments and unreasonable ramp and user fees. AOPA is making progress ensuring 100LL supply and what Ginter calls “a smart transition” to unleaded avgas.</p> <p>Each AOPA representative on the call expressed appreciation for the work the RAF does, and for the relationship between the two organizations.</p> <p>The services these advocates provide are another benefit of AOPA membership. The RAF encourages all pilots to support the organization that for 80 years has worked to protect our freedom to fly.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aopa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOPA</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted September 30, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

When the ranger station’s administrative functions were relocated to Prineville, OR in 2013, the airstrip, constructed in the 1930s, had become hazardous due to encroaching brush, surface damage caused by wildlife and livestock, and the disappearance of the windsock.&nbsp;A collaboration was agreed whereby the RAF&nbsp;would provide a windsock, picnic table and fire ring, and volunteers would maintain the airstrip and camping area, while the Forest Service would manage noxious weeds and livestock incursions.</p> <p>This year, the USFS made significant improvements by bringing heavy equipment to grade and profile the gravel surface of the airstrip. “These improvements have increased the safety of the airstrip, making it suitable for use by a wider variety of aircraft and pilot capabilities,” Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes said, adding, “We want to thank the Paulina District Ranger, Scott McFarland for leading this effort and for strengthening the ongoing collaboration between the USFS and the RAF.” Oregon Liaison Bill Ables added, “On behalf of the RAF and all aviators who use this airstrip, a big THANK YOU. What you and your folks did moved the safety bar up many notches for both administrative and recreational use. Thanks again Scott for your forethought in the upgrading of the Rager airstrip.”</p> <p>For more information on&nbsp;Rager&nbsp;USFS Airstrip see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/7796a65f-81a9-484a-811a-1fc2a6a47635/overview?searchQuery=rager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted September 16, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Property owners Ryan and Marianne Larrance agreed, and offered to provide the water for the shower, and&nbsp;labor and equipment, including an excavator. PerryCook developed drawings, and scoped the project, and Ballantyne was awarded an RAF grant for materials. PerryCook organized other volunteers and they broke ground on August 2.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the following two weekends, Kyle Williams,&nbsp;Oregon Ambassador&nbsp;Kevin Johnson,&nbsp;Tim Nichols, and Dave Riffle joined Jay, Ray, and the Larrances on the bathhouse construction. They also built a 20-foot stairway and rock pathway down the hill to facilitate access. To share the new facilities,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Larrances welcomed pilots and neighbors for a fly-in and concert August 24.</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="948" height="1000" data-id="17012" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shower-House.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17012" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shower-House.jpg 948w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shower-House-284x300.jpg 284w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shower-House-768x810.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" data-id="17014" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Stairs-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17014" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Stairs-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Stairs-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Stairs-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Stairs.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure> </figure> <p>Ballantyne says that the region is known as the “Lavender Capital of North America,” and Discovery Bay has clean water along forested slopes.&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;Field offers a quiet and secluded place to camp. Just over the hill to the west is&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;National Park, with glaciated mountains, temperate rainforests, and the rugged Washington coastline.&nbsp;</p> <p>If biking, running, or hiking are your interests, the 126-mile&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;Discovery Trail can be accessed down the hill from camp. It follows the Old Seattle &amp; North Coast Railroad grade.</p> <p>Ballantyne points out that Ryan’s parents used to host an annual party for neighbors and the aviation community, and this August event marked the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of their first one. “Their last fly-in, they had 400 people! Now the next generation is carrying on the tradition and is also welcoming recreational aviation campers. Just let them know you’re coming,&#8221; Ballantyne says.

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Clay Simmons, a young pilot and member of the RAF&#8217;s Backcountry Etiquette Team.</em></p> <p>I’m supposed to be the adult now?</p> <p>When I say I’ve been flying my whole life, it sounds facetious, but it&#8217;s about 99 percent truth. At 10 days old (ish, as it has been a debate) I took my first flight. Since then I have been fortunate enough to see all types of aviation, from the fast and high turbines, to the lowest and slowest of pistons, and a few aircraft in between. I have forever been enamored with anything that defies gravity, despite my wallet’s disdain for the passion.</p> <p>It was only natural that my corner of aviation is full of the backcountry machines, in the remote environments, as this is how I experienced it growing up. With some phenomenal help, I became one of the youngest airplane builders, finishing a carbon cub just after my 22nd birthday. This leads to the adventures west (thank goodness for autopilot!), where we can see the beauty of the country, the incredible terrain, and of course, the kind of flying we at the RAF all love so much.</p> <p>I was inadvertently thrust into a position of, at least partially, representing a generation of aviators. At 23 years old, I am about as young and green as they come, but I love to help out and lean in where I can. Along with this has come a unique sense of purpose. I consider myself to be one of the luckiest kids around, getting to experience so much of aviation in just over two decades, so now my focus has shifted. How can I give back? How do I start making a difference now, to give my grandchildren the same wonder I have been able to experience?</p> <p>The answer is quite simple: we already do.</p> <p>Whenever I am at the airport, I am the first person to invite anyone, especially kids, to poke at the airplane, sit in it, and explain how things work in an age-appropriate manner. This often leads to the parents learning a thing or two, and profusely thanking me. My response is always the same “Well, it wasn’t very long ago that I was the kid wanting to sit in airplanes too!”. And candidly, nothing makes me happier than sharing what I love so much, and I’d wager if you’re reading this, you’re in the same boat.</p> <p>This is the giving back that I had been chasing. I had been doing it all along, but I believed that I needed to make a scene out of it, that I had to preach to hundreds of people why aviation matters, how you can make a living in it, and what you need to do, but that’s not the beginning, that’s the end. It starts with one person taking 30 seconds to share what they love. That is the impact.</p> <p>I am very fortunate to be a part of the backcountry etiquette committee, a group within the RAF dedicated to creating guidelines for how to operate in the remote spaces in order to be most symbiotic with all other parties such as hikers, bikers, rafters, rangers, and more. I talk about giving back and inviting kids into the airplanes, but this is the bigger picture of that purpose. Protecting and curating the spaces we love so much is why we do it. As fun as it is to go enjoy these amazing places, it’s always better with friends and family.</p> <p>I was fortunate enough to converse with Bill McGlynn about some of these same topics that extend throughout aviation. Getting kids involved, protecting the space we love, and promoting safety. It was a great conversation with some fantastic ideas shared, but the two of us cannot solve these issues alone, it takes an army. That’s part of the reason I love the chance to speak on the topics I hold so dearly, because if even a single person uses it as their reason to invoke change, I’m all for it.</p> <p>Despite the ramble, I leave you with an ask:</p> <p>Lean into the 30 second interactions at the airport.</p> <p>Those 30 seconds of opening someone’s eyes to aviation is the foundation for all of the things that the RAF stands for, the things that we, as pilots and enthusiasts should stand for, and in reality, what aviation is about. Those 30 seconds are how we build our army, to protect aviation for those who get to be the caretakers next. I look forward to seeing y’all in the sky!</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:47% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="974" height="737" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5655-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-16964 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5655-1.jpeg 974w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5655-1-300x227.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5655-1-768x581.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Clay Simmons is a cub pilot, and aircraft sales associate for Aerista.

It opened a new chapter of his passion to inspire others. After 8,000 VFR hours in everything from PiperCubs, an AirCam, Stearman, to a P-51, and a lot of grease under his fingernails, he gets just as much pleasure sharing the joy of flight from the right seat, or terra firma.</p> <p>Both his parents had flown for the Civil Air Patrol, which ignited Pat’s early interest in aviation. Now he finds joy in his family partnership – that includes friend and pilot Pat Derrick – managing Triple Tree Aerodrome in Woodruff, South Carolina. Along with his wife, Mary Lou, Pat gave the land to Triple Tree Aerodrome, the 501c3, that now includes an aircraft museum and seven thousand feet of groomed turf in the middle of their 400 acres of beautiful South Carolina. During scheduled events, they invite everyone to land, camp under their wing, stroll through their remarkable collection of aircraft, or enjoy their four-star Hotel Hartness just a few minutes from the field. Who wouldn’t be excited to stay in the resort that Travel and Leisure rated “First in the State” – and Number Three in the nation?</p> <p>Pat explains that, “Our partnership set up the charity in order to continue maintaining it all as ‘Everybody’s Airport’. We’re boutique,” he added. “We’re not interested in commercial development, or hosting vendors, just interested in people.” He pointed out that they’ll host 80,000 visitors a year. They state that the place is “two-and-a-half times the size of Disneyland,” and his wife Mary Lou and their entire family all take part in the aerodrome business, and managing the hotel.&nbsp;</p> <p>A large part of Pat’s joy comes from mentoring young people. “We’re passing the torch to these young people,” he said proudly. Pat encouraged one youth to fly Triple Tree’s Piper Cub to each state in the Lower 48. “He had to wait for thermals to make it over Homestake Pass,” Pat said, “but he said the scenery was awful pretty on the way down. We challenge young people like that. We believe in them, they are competent,” he added. A man of his word, in July, he sent that young man and three other young pilots off in the museum’s 87-year-old 450-hp Spartan Executive to AirVenture, to negotiate the hubbub of mixed aircraft, all arriving at OSH at different airspeeds. “Their combined ages were less than the age of the airplane,” he exclaimed.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="493" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0817-1-1-1024x493.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17215" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0817-1-1-1024x493.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0817-1-1-300x144.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0817-1-1-768x369.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0817-1-1-1536x739.jpg 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_0817-1-1-2048x985.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure> <p>Another way Pat inspires others is by hosting a huge group of radio-controlled aircraft enthusiasts. He trains and mentors them, and says that probably 70 to 80 percent go on to fly powered flight, many commercially. “You can learn an awful lot flying a radio-controlled aircraft safely. It teaches the principles of flight, and an RC aircraft requires every input, accurately,” he said. Annually, RC enthusiasts comprise about half of Triple Tree’s total attendance.</p> <p>Pat met the RAF at Lakeland, FL around 2006, about the same time Triple Tree started their full scale fly-ins, and he immediately became a supporter. “We have similar missions – people who are putting airports together. It’s what we are all about,” he said. Like the RAF, Triple Tree welcomes volunteers who often use their vacations to pitch in maintaining the place in pristine condition, and it’s obvious they come and work for something more than Pat and Mary Lou’s free lunch.&nbsp;</p> <p>To ensure that passion for aviation continues, Pat points out that profits from aerodrome activities go into flight scholarships, amounting to $25,000 each year. Pat is working toward expanding their on-site education center for folks of all ages to embark on aviation’s learning path. The aerodrome hosts summer camps for both GA and RC students, an entire portfolio of learning opportunities in its Aviation Centered Education, or ACE programs. Pat supported the development of AviCom – the first ever simulated flying competition for high school teens.</p> <p>In closing, Pat invites everyone to Triple Tree’s annual week-long fly-in September 23-29. “It’s like no other airport. Bring your fishing pole, hiking shoes, and plan on making some friends,” he said.

Thomas anticipates it can be placed and ready for use the first week of September. &nbsp;</p> <p>“Team&nbsp;Goodspeed&nbsp;donated a triple-axle load of stone for the project and allowed me to borrow the trailer to pick up supplies. Most importantly, we could not have done this without all the support from RAF donors as well as the pilots local to&nbsp;Goodspeed. It was a great team effort,” Thomas said.</p> <p>“Goodspeed&nbsp;is a poster-perfect picturesque New England airport nestled next to the Connecticut River,” Thomas added. Just steps away from the airport is the opportunity for fishing and kayaking; and the town of East Haddam with its Opera House, fine dining, and coffee shops.&nbsp;</p> <p>For information on Goodspeed, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/92971b87-7822-4331-a4b0-5d9e10685584/overview?searchQuery=goodspeed">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted August 30, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

It’s near a population of active pilots, just&nbsp;north of the St. Louis Class B airspace,&nbsp;but can still be reached by unequipped aircraft.&nbsp;Warner is using the grant to provide a second windsock, and owners Mike and Tammy Herren will supply the post, concrete, labor and equipment to install it. The grant will also fund an improved RAF fire ring, and Herren will level, install, and provide pavers surrounding it.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Herren-Bess-Hollow-3-fire-pit-location-resized.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16794" style="width:351px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Herren-Bess-Hollow-3-fire-pit-location-resized.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Herren-Bess-Hollow-3-fire-pit-location-resized-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Herren-Bess-Hollow-3-fire-pit-location-resized-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Proposed location for the RAF Fire Ring <br>at Herren-Bess Hollow Airport</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>The Herrens welcome visitors and continue to build attractions to those already available. “We stumbled on to one of their occasional crawfish boils last year when we dropped in to camp,” Warner said, adding, “The attendees really enjoyed themselves, and all were impressed by the quality of everything the Herrens did and their overwhelming hospitality.</p> <p>The inviting field lies in hilly country between the Mississippi and Illinois rivers, very nearthe free Kampsville ferry that crosses the Illinois River.

A group of local volunteers, headed up by Bowman Field Flying Club President Nathan Hurd, will provide all the labor. The airport is privately owned by the Club, and open to the public.</p> <p>The turf field is 2,200 feet long, with a seaplane base within a short walk of the airfield. “Bowman offers camping under the stars away from the bright city lights.” Grenier said. It lies alongside the Androscoggin River, a favorite with canoeists. “It’s known for great fishing, catching rainbow and brown trout. If largemouth bass is what you’re after, Androscoggin Lake is just three miles south of the airfield,” he added. There is a small convenience store within a mile of the airfield, and fuel is available at the airfield and seaplane base, making Bowman Field an ideal gateway to North Country flying.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="960" height="488" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bowman-Field-.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16873" style="width:392px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bowman-Field-.jpg 960w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bowman-Field--300x153.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bowman-Field--768x390.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></figure></div> <p>Grenier expects completion of the restrooms in time for Bowman’s 38th annual fly-in August 24 and 25, 2024. Hosts promise attractions for all ages, with a candy drop, airplane rides, a yard sale, raffles, door prizes, STOL competition and food available for sale. For the fly-in, there will be a shuttle for visitors arriving by seaplane.</p> <p>Maine is famous for fall colors, and the town of Livermore Falls celebrates the harvest season with an annual Apple Pumpkin Festival the last Saturday of September.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/c5cbaabf-663a-45b3-b7db-eba31cf428ea/overview?searchQuery=Bowman">Airfield Guide</a> for more information about Bowman Field.</p> <p><em>Submitted on August 13<br>by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

He became a practitioner of the aviation arts on earning his private license in 1977, followed soon after by various other tickets. Instrument flying and soaring have been highlights. He&#8217;s owned his Bonanza since 1993.</p> <p>Professionally, Rick has spent “far too many hours not flying,” he says. His first career was in software and database development. The second time around, Rick was a middle-school teacher and, later, an administrator. The latter work included much data analysis and administration of federal and state grants.</p> <p>“Another formative experience was backpacking,” Rick says, “as some of my best memories were formed in the roadless backcountry of the mountain West.” He hasn&#8217;t yet combined aviation with love of the high country but is moving in that direction with his recent tailwheel endorsement and planning for that next airplane, one that might be more backcountry-ready than his Bonanza.</p> <p>Lately, Rick&#8217;s time has been focused on environmental concerns. He conducts wildlife surveys for the state of Vermont and the Audubon Society. He also flies photo surveys for land trusts through&nbsp;<a href="http://lighthawk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lighthawk.org</a>. This work takes Rick into the world of aerial imagery analysis and GIS systems. He currently serves as a commissioner for the regional solid waste district.</p> <p>Rick believes in the RAF mission and goals. He began volunteering in 2018, and since then, he&#8217;s gotten involved with PowerPoint support and analytics for the RAF Outfitter. He&#8217;s also handled reservations for the Ryan Field cabins for the past several seasons. He looks forward to other challenges to come.</p> ]]>

RAF Montana Liaison Scott Newpower reported that about 15 people flew in to help this year. All the while, a 27-pound foil-wrapped beef roast was slow-roasting for eight hours in wood coals in a pit the volunteers dug.</p> <p>Newpower and RAF supporter Mitch Fontenot flew in a picnic table that volunteers assembled. Workers raked and smoothed dirt mounds caused by animals and filled gopher holes. During last year&#8217;s work party, the crew had cut down several hundred small pine trees. This year, the volunteers gathered them in piles to be burned by USFS crews when burning conditions are favorable. Fynnley Dyk and her grandfather TJ Reynolds helped on that project. The outhouse was cleaned, and a small stream was cleared of overgrown grass to help prevent flooding. Both windsocks were also replaced.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="995" height="729" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fynnley-Dyk-and-her-grandfather-TJ-Reynolds.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16820" style="width:494px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fynnley-Dyk-and-her-grandfather-TJ-Reynolds.jpg 995w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fynnley-Dyk-and-her-grandfather-TJ-Reynolds-300x220.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fynnley-Dyk-and-her-grandfather-TJ-Reynolds-768x563.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px" /></figure></div> <p>“As always, Loren Smith from Great Falls provided the dinner,” Newpower said. The meal was flown in by Pete Smith and Jeff Patnode from Lewistown. “Working the underground oven this year was Pete Smith, Scott Kirsch, Brad Young and Mark Bailer,” Newpower added. </p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="688" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Beef-roast-1024x688.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16819" style="width:468px;height:auto"/></figure></div> <p>Schafer Meadows is a popular camping area, and it’s close to the Middle Fork of the Flathead River, a popular for rafting and fishing. Due to the Wilderness area and other recreational users, short stops and flight training is discouraged. The ranger station grazes their horses and mules on the runway. When the American flag is down at ranger station livestock is ON the runway.</p> <p>For more information on Schafer Meadow, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/ce77d361-a6b2-4ed7-b66a-0d8c0162ae54/overview?searchQuery=schafer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 31, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

The campground located on the ‘triangle’ between the two runways was buried in waist-deep debris from downed trees and limbs. The Forest Service responded quickly, and within a day fire crews armed with chainsaws flew in on a Twin Otter and limbed up the downed trees and bucked the logs into rounds. Repairs on the two buildings started a day later. Now came time for the clean-up.</p> <p>The RAF volunteered to help, and the Forest Service was quick to accept. RAF requested use of a Kodiak from partner Daher in Sandpoint, ID, which was quickly approved and plans were made to transport a seven-person Montana Conservation Corp (partner of AmeriCorps) crew from Missoula to Moose Creek. The MCC crew arrived on August 13 and will spend 8 days at Moose Creek moving log rounds and piling up debris for future burn piles to make the pilot campground usable again.</p> <p>We can’t thank Daher-Kodiak enough for their support that allows us to do this noble work on behalf of backcountry pilots. The Kodiak is perfect for the mission of getting crews into backcountry airstrips.</p> <p>For those of you who would like to stay apprised of conditions at Moose Creek &#8211; go to the RAF Airfield Guide and read the “Comments” section of the Moose Creek (1U1) page for latest status. As of now, both runways are open and in good condition, and water is available at the Ranger Station. One outhouse in the campground was damaged but still okay for use.</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" data-id="16889" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0092-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16889" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0092-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0092-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0092-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0092-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0092-rotated.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" data-id="16888" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0095-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16888" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0095-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0095-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0095-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0095-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0095-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">RAF&#8217;s Steve Taylor &amp; Kodiak&#8217;s Paul Carelli</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p><em>Submitted August 14, 2024</em></p> ]]>

The organization became a nonprofit in 1990, and since then has garnered hundreds of partners from federal and state agencies, industry leaders such as Jeep, Nissan, Kawasaki, and Firestone, and recreational user groups, too numerous to mention. Like the RAF, all share the goal to preserve recreation access and opportunity by promoting ethics of good stewardship.</p> <p>“Our intentions align perfectly,” RAF President Bill McGlynn said, adding, “And we are proud to be the vanguard aviation organization included as ‘partner’.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Executive Director Matt Gaskins was equally pleased to loop in the RAF, and add the aviation component of recreational access.&nbsp; “I love what you’re doing with your campaign. It’s all about keeping these recreational assets sustainable in the future. The best way is doing our part to minimize our impact,” he said, adding, “We are very excited to help with the commendable mission you have. The industry needs this element.”</p> <p>While Gaskins’ career path includes mostly corporate finance, he loves to share his passion for sustainable outdoor recreation and teach responsible 4&#215;4 techniques. After working for Rivian in treasury and special projects, he spent time with Rivian Clubs of America, Lexus, and Land Rover as an advisor, consultant, and instructor.</p> <p>He had an epiphany about&nbsp;two decades ago in the alpine tundra of Colorado where the growing season is short. “When damage is created, even a simple footprint or tire track, it may take decades or centuries to recover. Around Moab, some of the cryptobiotic soils took hundreds of years to develop. Step or drive on them, they are likely to die. Wind, snow, and rain accelerate erosion; more erosion can lead to trail closure.”</p> <p>Gaskins shared his observations on the explosion of social media. “We’ve gone from a journalism model where media was mostly controlled by a few large corporations to a time where anyone with a smartphone has become a de facto journalist”.&nbsp; He agreed there is a strong “watch me” element driving the speed of dissemination, making it hard to control the narrative. “One strategy we have tried is to work with influencers to help us with our message. Social media rewards things that drive engagement. So if you share content that’s educational and inspiring like – How do I improve my experience while protecting the environment –&nbsp;it’s a winning combination.”</p> <p>To accomplish this goal, Tread Lightly embarked on a massive education campaign of stewardship projects, signage at trailheads, online and in-person courses. Tread Lightly’s 2023 annual&nbsp;<a href="https://treadlightly.org/tl-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Impact Report</a>&nbsp;states that 641 educational signs were installed at trailheads; and their volunteers removed over 241,000 pounds of trash from public lands that year alone.</p> <p>One simple example Matt suggested to minimize impact is lowering&nbsp;air pressure in tires prior to off highway use. It spreads the impact and creates less trail or road damage. While aircraft don’t use driving wheels, shifting airstrip cones from side to side every year or so will disperse aircraft tire impact, and conserve the runway surface. See&nbsp;<a href="https://treadlightly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tread Lightly’s website</a>&nbsp;for much more information.</p> <p>“We received a lot of great feedback when we announced our new partnership with Tread Lightly, and agree with Matt that education is better than enforcement or regulation,&#8221;&nbsp; RAF Backcountry Etiquette Team Chair Lynn Mareth said. “Our team has&nbsp;been working on the new messaging campaign, so watch for new signage,” she added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“We are more effective when people of similar values connect. It magnifies our impact. When I listen to new viewpoints, I always learn and find things we can use in our toolkit to become more effective with our message. We definitely are stronger together,” Gaskins added.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray<br>Posted August 15, 2024</em></p> ]]>

Several RAF volunteers gladly accompanied the 22-year-old around the event and learned about him, and his grand experience flying around the US two years ago.</p> <p>Philipp&nbsp;started flying gliders at 16 and got his glider license at 17. He thought about flying for a living and added his powered private license at 19. But to earn the ratings he needed, he said, “I started thinking to add flight hours in the US, where you can fly more cheaply than in Germany.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“I wrote a general inquiry to the RAF with my plan, they directed me to Colorado Liaison, Tom Haefeli,” he began. “I also had a huge printed map of the Lower Forty-eight, and had marked a few interesting airports using the Airfield Guide.” Sarah Tamar, then-RAF New York Ambassador had recently done a similar trip, and gave him tips on the Guide and “flamping” in general.&nbsp;</p> <p>Philipp&nbsp;flew commercially to Denver and spent ten days in a hotel near Centennial in order to train with a local flight instructor. “I profited a lot from that instruction. It was incredibly valuable,” he said.</p> <p>It was a struggle finding an airplane but he had success with a flying club at Centennial, renting an old but reliable Cessna 172. “I had a small selection of tools and oil, and several liters of water,” mindful of the southwestern deserts, and the possibility of unplanned time there. Now he was ready to begin his major US cross-country, “One regret was that the aircraft was not insured for unpaved airports which obviously limited my options. But that information was in the Airfield Guide. It was an amazing planning tool for me to find airfields where I could camp, take a shower, maybe use a car, find food.”&nbsp;Philipp&nbsp;relished the way pilots must adapt to the uncertainties flying GA aircraft. But one constant was the warmth and helpfulness of everyone he met, he said.</p> <p>That trip accumulated about 100 flying hours for Philipp. </p> <p>This summer,&nbsp;Philipp&nbsp;decided to attend AirVenture. He reconnected with the RAF, and Director Jeff Russell put him in touch with some Wisconsin folks who volunteer at the international camping area – the perfect place for&nbsp;Philipp&nbsp;to pitch his tent for his first time in Oshkosh, and his last bit of free time&nbsp;before University and the military.</p> <p>Of all his experiences,&nbsp;Philipp&nbsp;says his most memorable is, “Definitely the people. Connections with all the RAF guys. It’s been unbelievably amazing. Outstanding.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Even someone from as far away as Bavaria can get ”The RAF Way.”</p> <p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Images from Philipp&#8217;s trip, courtesy of Philipp Kureck</em>:</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="964" data-id="16879" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16879" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip-300x289.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip-768x740.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="850" data-id="16880" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-trip-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16880" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-trip-1.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-trip-1-300x255.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-trip-1-768x653.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="905" height="1000" data-id="16882" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16882" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip-3.png 905w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip-3-272x300.png 272w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kureck-Trip-3-768x849.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px" /></figure> </figure> <p><em>Submitted August 14, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Steve Maus, an RAF Ambassador and estate/business succession planning professional.</em></p> <p><strong>What’s This About a Turtle?</strong></p> <p>Sitting in an orange rocker on the porch of the Ryan barn watching aircraft from all around the country during the RAF Fly In caused me a moment of reflection. Someone, something, or some event had to happen that allows me to enjoy this and other magical places we love as we fly around the country. This someone, something, or event did not begin with the guy I stare at in the mirror every morning.</p> <p>One cannot walk down a sidewalk, sit on a park bench, walk through a museum, watch movie credits, attend a musical, go to the zoo, or just saunter through life without being reminded that people, events, or circumstances beyond our own making are what allows us to be so enriched. Enjoying Ryan Field demonstrates that these were not faceless, nameless, people. Ben, Butchie – and many others – are real people, just as those names on the park bench, a display at the museum, and the exhibit at the zoo. These honorable folks may be gone, but what they created is a wonderful reminder to each of us that people or events in our own lives have molded who we are, what we have become, and what we value.</p> <p>Whether a brief or long-lasting influence, we may not even realize the impact at first. Maybe scouting, your scoutmaster taught you to build a fire, pitch a tent, or bait a hook. My scoutmaster’s name was Red. Do you remember yours? Maybe your 4-H leader? Civil Air Patrol? Those days may be gone, but not the memories, or the impact. Personally, my first solo takeoff became an emergency as soon as I lifted the gear. A fire truck with flashing lights met me upon landing. Ready to hang it up, John, my flight instructor said, “Go fly another plane right now — here’s the tail number!” John, wherever you are, thanks for being there for me. I am still in the air.</p> <p>During the June RAF conference in Bozeman, I shared a story that I’m told is worthy of repeating for those who were not able to attend. Imagine a grandfather flying his young granddaughter into an RAF-supported backcountry airstrip, her introduction to the wonders of flying to special places. After an early morning flight, the two began a walk through the woods together. A short distance beyond, they came on an interesting sight. There was an old fence. On top of one of the fence posts sat a large turtle. The little girl turned to her grandfather and asked, “What is that turtle doing up there?” Granddad responded, “Turtles spend their entire life slowly moving from place to place with their noses no higher than a few inches from the ground. I suspect that turtle stopped at this fence post, looked up, and wished he could see a sunrise from a better vantage point.”</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 47%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>“But how did he get way up there, Granddad?”&nbsp;</p> <p>“You know turtles can’t climb, so someone came along and gave him a helping hand.”</p> <p>“So, how does he get down?” she asked.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Well, either someone else helps him down, or he jumps, and if he lands on his back, someone coming along will help turn him right side up so he can continue on his way,” he replied.&nbsp;</p> </div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="647" height="647" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fullsizerender.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-16766 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fullsizerender.webp 647w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fullsizerender-300x300.webp 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fullsizerender-150x150.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></figure></div> <p>Isn’t this much like the storied past of the RAF? Someone came along before, made their generous mark on us, then continued quietly so others may enjoy the fruits of their efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Winston Churchill famously stated, “We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="541" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-085821-1024x541.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16768" style="width:456px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-085821-1024x541.png 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-085821-300x158.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-085821-768x406.png 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-085821-1536x811.png 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-16-085821.png 1801w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div> <p>There’s more to this story. Years later, the little girl who flew into the backcountry that day with her Granddad became an accomplished aviator. She, her husband, and little son now access many of the same magical places she learned about from her granddad. There is always a walk down a trail to look for another turtle gazing skyward…</p> <p>Now, not everyone finds turtles warm and cuddly. But most folks have a passion for something that, thanks to someone or some special experience in their past, inspires them to go the extra mile to offer others the same uplifting passion or experience, like the Ryans, among others. &nbsp;</p> <p>If your wish were to help the RAF reach one of its goals, what would that be? What would it take to make this mutual wish become reality?&nbsp; What could you do when you see someone gazing skyward?</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:29% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="945" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0789-1-1024x945.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16764 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0789-1-1024x945.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0789-1-300x277.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0789-1-768x709.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0789-1.jpg 1357w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Steve spent 45 years in an estate, business succession, executive compensation, and charitable legacy planning practice.

The energy around the RAF mission was apparent throughout the event grounds, with spontaneous happy reunions happening among supporters who easily recognized one another in their “RAF orange” attire. Attendance was enthusiastic at the RAF’s planned events as well.</p> <p>Throughout the week the&nbsp;impressive&nbsp;RAF-branded Husky was on display in the Redbird Flight Simulators booth where RAF volunteers helped answer&nbsp;questions about Simuvation&#8217;s RAF-branded sim on display.&nbsp;Attendees were encouraged to board the sim and try their hand “flying” the RAF-branded Husky into a selection of RAF-supported recreational airstrips. “That was fun!” was heard on more than one occasion after folks tried their skills landing virtually at Ryan Field (2MT1) and other turf strips.</p> <p>True to an RAF annual tradition, supporters enjoyed the donuts and coffee social on Hartzell’s rooftop Tuesday morning. RAF Directors Pete Bunce and Jeff Russell expressed appreciation to the standing-room-only crowd. At the conclusion of the event, Bunce and Russell led the group on a walkabout to take &#8220;family&#8221; photos at the displays of various industry partners.</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="534" data-id="16824" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Group-Photo-at-Daher-Osh-1024x534.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16824"/></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-id="16825" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Group-Photo-Husky-Osh-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16825"/></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-id="16826" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Group-Photo-Redbird-Osh-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16826"/></figure> </figure> <p>Throughout the week at the Brown Arch, visitors found a spot of shade and viewed the growing list of RAF volunteer names etched in stone. This tribute to RAF volunteerism was made possible thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor.&nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF thanks Hartzell Propeller, Redbird Flight Simulators, Aviat Aircraft, and Daher-Kodiak&nbsp; for their support at OSH; and thanks all the volunteers who made our donuts and coffee social, and Redbird booth participation so successful.</p> <p>We look forward to another fun-filled week in Wisconsin in 2025!</p> <p><em>Submitted July 31, 2024</em></p> ]]>

Matt Hoefeldt from Aviat had arranged for this special aircraft to make an appearance on its way to Oshkosh for Airventure. It will be displayed with RAF-branded Redbird Simulators, as a visual partnership between the RAF, Aviat Husky, and Redbird, that has added backcountry flying to its curriculum.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Daisies-Ryan-Field.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16747" style="width:411px;height:auto"/></figure></div> <p>Over 100 supporters participated in the fly-in, some flying in by Husky from as far as central Florida. Attendees spread tents beneath their aircraft wings, and some enjoyed filling the four cabins on-site. Many commented on the beauty of the place, results of RAF volunteers’ efforts to continue stewardship, and maintain the amenities that have been added for campers’ comfort and enjoyment. Throughout the weekend, hospitality tasks like coffee making, garbage removal and “KP” were done seamlessly by a cadre of volunteers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The group gathered in the barn Friday afternoon for an educational presentation by&nbsp;Justine&nbsp;Vallieres&nbsp;of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks on living and recreating safely in bear country. Friday night’s dinner was abundant tacos fresh from caterer Mike Lindemer’s “Lindy’s” food truck. As darkness fell over the pastoral airfield, folks gathered around the two fire rings for live acoustic music and song.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ryan-Friends.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16748" style="width:375px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ryan-Friends.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ryan-Friends-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ryan-Friends-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div> <p>Saturday morning the coffee flowed and everyone enjoyed Lindy’s huckleberry pancakes and sausage. Several gathered in time for the forested hike around the airfield led by RAF Montana Ambassador Lynn Mareth and Supporter Berkley Hudson. Dr. Brent Blue, AME, spoke later that afternoon on Basic Med and survival techniques in the backcountry. Dinner was Lindy’s signature steak sandwiches with optional sautéed mushrooms and onions – unanimously rated “best” – followed by huckleberry ice cream sandwiches for dessert.</p> <p>We appreciate everyone who made the effort to attend. Thank you all for making this fly-in another safe and wonderful get-together! As always, we appreciate your donations to help cover airfield and facilities maintenance costs. </p> <p><em>Submitted on July 12<br>by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Gillettes have made the tipi available for visiting aviators to use.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>The group repaired the hangar roof, felled a large dead oak, installed the pier and swim raft for the season, and stained the porch on the house. The RAF thanks volunteer Jim Baker for bringing a skid loader and grading the gravel driveways.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gillette’s&nbsp;Lakewood&nbsp;Lodge&nbsp;airfield features camping, canoeing, cycling, swimming, and fishing – accessible from its 2,137-ft turf runway.&nbsp;Bob and Judy are passionate about aviation, after respective careers in the industry.&nbsp;The RAF is so thankful to share the ownership of Gillette&#8217;s Lakewood Lodge and look forward to many years of work parties and celebrations with Bob and Judy.</p> <p>&#8220;We are so fortunate to enjoy&nbsp;the friendship of Bob and Judy and to share their passion for preserving a treasure like Lakewood Lodge!

It typically&nbsp;begins on Thursday, with a fish fry on Friday eve, picnic on Saturday, and Sunday morning’s hearty “everything scramble&#8221;.&nbsp;The spring work party will also be announced, so watch for a call for volunteers likely in late May or early June, 2025.</p> <p><em>Submitted on July 12, 2024<br>by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Additional improvements planned are the installation of several RAF branded fire rings on a base of crushed stone, and park style barbecue grills.

He found a used Husqvarna commercial grade riding lawn mower, “that had been maintained in an impeccable condition with less than 300 hours on it,” for well below market value.&nbsp;With its purchase and weed whacking tools,&nbsp;Thomas has recruited RAF volunteers, both Connecticut State Liaisons, and Ambassadors to <br>assist with weekly mowing and weed whacking during the spring, summer and fall camping season.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Waterbury-outhouse-and-volunteers.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16724" style="width:408px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Waterbury-outhouse-and-volunteers.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Waterbury-outhouse-and-volunteers-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Waterbury-outhouse-and-volunteers-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Waterbury volunteers</strong> <strong>and new construction.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>The grant included the cost of an informational kiosk for volunteers to assemble and install at Waterbury, as well.<br><br>For information on each of these airfields, see these links in the Airfield Guide:<br><a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/auth/sign-in">Goodsp</a><a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/92971b87-7822-4331-a4b0-5d9e10685584/overview?searchQuery=goodspeed">eed</a><br><a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/auth/sign-in">Waterbur</a><a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/2ff0125d-a358-4016-9104-2bbf8b09dd53/overview?searchQuery=waterbury">y</a></p> <p><em>Submitted on July 12, 2024<br>by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Ask the BLM to please include these four airstrips as open designated airstrips in the final TMP alternative selected.&nbsp;</li> <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Please include Gilson’s Butte airstrip in the TMP, either in the current revision of the TMP or as soon as possible thereafter.&nbsp;</li> <li>Tell the BLM that as pilots, we support limiting use of airstrips to aircraft only, but are open to allowing combined use with other OHVs. Signage requesting that OHVs not drive on landing surface (runway) would minimize ruts and would make combined use safer.&nbsp;</li> <li>Aircraft meet the definition of an OHV and should continue to access the same designated routes that are open to other OHVs. Ask the BLM to please avoid language in the TMP that restricts aircraft to only landing on designated airstrips.&nbsp;</li> <li>Aircraft are the lightest impact motorized access to Utah’s spectacular backcountry.</li> <li>Ask the BLM to not eliminate access to an airstrip because of encroaching vegetation. Pilot organizations, such as the RAF and&nbsp;Utah Back Country Pilots&nbsp;(UBCP)&nbsp;regularly rally volunteers to perform airstrip maintenance to make them safer for use. Airstrips are already previously-disturbed areas, and with a day or two of work, most airstrips can be adequately maintained.&nbsp;</li> <li>Aircraft noise within the San Rafael Swell TMP area is short term and transient. Once on the ground, pilots and their passengers value the peaceful, quiet tranquility of the Utah backcountry for dispersed primitive camping, similar to hikers and backpackers.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Your comments should be personal and tell the BLM what access to the backcountry airstrips means to you, to making memories with your friends and family, enjoying backcountry environment while making a very light footprint on the land.</p> <p>Simply use this&nbsp;button&nbsp;to comment&nbsp;<strong>by July 22, 2024</strong>:</p> <div class="wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"> <div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/1500146/595/8020412/comment">Click here to comment on the San Rafael Swell TMP</a></div> </div> <p><em>Above photo by Wendy Lessig of Hidden Splendor.</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

He reports that the airport owners are very appreciative of the collective efforts from the local pilot community to keep Waterbury looking good through the summer flying season.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Planes have been rolling on this emerald strip of grass nestled in the quiet rolling hills of Connecticut since 1926. In fact if you could have been here in 1936 you would have been able to get a ride with Clarence Chamberlin in his Curtiss Condor for only a dollar,”&nbsp;Thomas says. To preserve its appeal, in 2023 he applied for and was awarded an RAF grant for improvements including a low-maintenance composting outhouse, picnic tables, several park style barbecue grills and upgrades to the two existing fire pits. Volunteers had previously added tent platforms and stocked plenty of firewood.</p> <p>The recent work party was plagued by heat and “pop-up” thunderstorms but the group accomplished many tasks. They did all the weed whacking requested by the owners, and mowed around fire pits and tent platforms, making them safe to use for the season. Some spread wood chips along the stairway to the airfield and sprayed weeds. An outhouse gutter was installed for rainwater collection. They cleaned all the picnic tables and outhouse woodwork, and installed the new composite floor in the shower.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="690" data-id="16675" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0567.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16675" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0567.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0567-300x207.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0567-768x530.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="769" data-id="16673" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0532.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16673" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0532.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0532-300x231.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0532-768x591.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> </figure> <p>“Thank you to all the volunteers that showed up and braved the elements!

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Scott Heck, a longtime RAF friend and supporter.</em></p> <p>It was the early 2000s when John McKenna asked me to fly into Ryan Field with him and Chuck Jarecki to meet Ben and Butchie and see their airfield. Afterward, we sat and talked about how – if we were to receive such a gift – to form an entity to hold the property. John, Chuck and others were creating the RAF to save airstrips, and rose to the opportunity Ryans were offering. As I write this, I am shaking my head in amazement. Through their hard work and the others who joined in early, an organization was formed that few would believe could have been achieved. </p> <p>Me? I went home and went back to work. My one contribution after that was when John called me to ask for a donation. He talked me into a “lifetime membership.” It wasn’t a hard sell. A few years later John called me and again asked for a donation. “I thought I had a lifetime membership,” I said. He responded, “You did, but your lifetime ran out.” So, I wrote a check and have written that check every year, just like many in the RAF family do.</p> <p>The RAF held its Volunteer Education Conference in Bozeman this year and my wife Barbara and I were invited. We offered to help in any way we could. We were assigned a couple of little odd jobs. All the heavy lifting had already been done by the entire three-person paid RAF staff: Tricia McKenna, Kodi Myhre, and Erin White and volunteers they’d rounded up. You read correctly. The RAF has just three paid staff, backed up by many volunteers, to take care of over 12,000 supporters. I find that amazing!</p> <p>About the conference – you had to be there to witness the enthusiasm, dedication, hard work and planning that was evident from panel presentations to audience participation with suggestions, anecdotes and questions.&nbsp;I have been to many conferences during my business life and most were, I am trying to think of the right word, maybe “nice”? This was fun!!&nbsp;A room full of people with the same agenda, and love for making it come to life. &nbsp;</p> <p>Dan Baker was one of several guest speakers. Dan started FlightAware as an 18-year-old for fun. The “fun” grew into a multi million-dollar business. He said FlightAware’s data capture is used by the airlines to manage arrivals, departures and create efficiency. And here I thought it was so I could track a friend. Then Charlie Gasmire (Airplane Academy) schooled all of us on his production efforts to promote aviation with short videos on YouTube. And you didn’t want to miss Charlie Gregoire of Redbird Flight Simulations talk about bringing simulators to you! And don’t forget a forum with Scott Haas of the US Forest Service. It turns out that the RAF really does have friends at the USFS that many in the RAF cultivated through tireless efforts.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the real eye opener was RAF Treasurer Mike Perkins’ presentation, what he warned would be the “driest” presentation of the conference. Boy, was he surprised, and so was I. He didn’t make it one minute into his presentation when the first hand shot in the air. Questions came continuously. Turns out, the RAF conferees were very tuned-in to how carefully our funds are being spent, and the projects that are in progress. You can trust this group to manage and spend the available funds to support RAF goals with the highest degree of integrity.</p> <p>Each conference attendee was given a special gift for attending. It was, by far, the best gift ever. The gals at HQ had spent the past year ducking into thrift stores and second-hand shops all over Montana to find nicely broken-in classic Western shirts with the pearl snaps. They had each one embroidered with the RAF logo, and everyone wore theirs at the barbecue at Bozeman’s “Big Yellow Barn.”</p> <p>I remember my first landing on grass 50 plus years ago and truly believe that once you have landed on grass you are never again really satisfied being in the “other” airport environment. I still remember my first flight, decades ago, into the Idaho backcountry. John and Tricia invited Barb and me to tag along as a flight of two for breakfast at Sulphur Creek. The approach started by following a ridge line paralleling the runway. You wonder how you are ever going to get down to land. But soon enough, a pass between two mountains comes into view and you start to descend in a left base to somewhere, because by now, the runway is long gone. My only thought was, “I hope John knows where he’s going.” Soon a left turn put us following a river with a few twists and turns and then, low and behold, there was the strip. Great breakfast, by the way.</p> <p>I have always liked wearing RAF gear but now, after the conference, I am especially proud to sport the RAF orange.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:40% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="666" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AVRAFCF7850.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16620 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AVRAFCF7850.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AVRAFCF7850-300x200.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AVRAFCF7850-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Scott Heck has been hooked on flying since his first flight lesson in 1967 and has been “blessed to fly low and slow and high and fast.” Heck spent a number of years in banking, taught finance at Montana State University, and with his wife Barbara owned a multi-county Montana title company for over 20 years. He is now retired and flies what Barbara calls “his fourth last-airplane,” an N-XCub.&nbsp;</em></p> </div></div> ]]>

Edie met her pilot husband Rob while pitching his aviation company to use her design services just as she was launching her own design business. Creating and placing their <em>AC Flyer</em> and <em>Controller </em>ads helped her business take flight. Rob’s long career in aviation has been diverse, and through the years many of his pilot colleagues have also become their friends. Rob discovered the RAF through one of these friends and has been excited about it ever since. Edie has had the pleasure to attend a few RAF events with Rob and found the enthusiasm at these gatherings undeniably contagious. She is happy to support this great organization with her graphic design, though she says that on balance she comes out way ahead as she has far too much fun doing it!</p> ]]>

In addition to the maintenance conducted at Dug Bar, Salmon Bar, Pittsburg Landing, Big Bar and Sluice Creek each was maintained with weed eaters, rakes, weed sprayers, walk-behind weed eaters, tractor mowers and riding lawn mowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Everyone met back at Dug Bar for a prepared lunch and friendly conversation. “This was one of the most productive one-day work parties we’ve had,” Ables exclaimed, adding, “Some of the folks came in a day early and camped out and were treated to a beautiful viewing of the northern lights.”</p> <p>Ables also serves as co-chair of the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative, (HCRC), a broad group of motorized and non-motorized recreation advocates who promote sustainable recreation through involvement and stewardship. They make recommendations to the US Forest Service to maintain and improve recreation access into the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes was an early proponent of the RAF’s involvement in HCRC, and was awarded an RAF grant toward its steering committee to clarify the RAF mission within HCRC goals.</p> <p>The RAF also recently supported the HCRC with a grant for a used four-wheeler, for use by volunteers conducting maintenance at Dug Bar.</p> <p>All these airstrips lie within the wild and scenic river corridor of the Hells Canyon National Recreation area.

RAF California Liaison Katerina Barilov was concerned that the closest weather currently available comes from Tonopah, NV, 82 nm away. In the interest of providing pilots accurate information to make better-informed decisions, Barilov applied for, and was awarded an RAF grant to install a Remote Solar-Powered APRS radio weather station at Chicken Strip. “This experimental weather station will not rely on cell phone, satellite, or wi-fi connectivity to transmit real-time dewpoint, wind velocity and direction, barometric pressure and temperature data via VHF radio to the internet,” Barilov said.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chickenstrip2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16474" style="width:365px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chickenstrip2.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chickenstrip2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chickenstrip2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div> <p>Barilov reports that the area’s extreme geology, with its 12,000-foot peaks to the west towering over the field elevation of 1,360 feet creates significant weather that can be severe. Extreme temperature fluctuations caused by daytime heat can stir up over 25-knot gusts. Having gotten approval from Park Superintendent Mike Reynolds, Barilov and RAF California Liaison Rick Lach will begin installation the first week of June with the assistance of the camp host. Allowing time for testing and permitting, Barilov expects the system to be permanently operational by the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p> <p>Three warm springs, fabled for their clothing-optional tradition, can be accessed by a half-mile walk from the airstrip within one of the largest essentially uninhabited valleys in the California desert. Capricious weather seasonally causes washouts across the runway and RAF and California pilot volunteers have routinely committed to grade and reclaim the airstrip, enduring the rough three-hour drive each way.</p> <p>For more information on Chicken Strip, see the<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/1a1fdba3-cb82-46ca-8acb-edf0e7ed2027/overview?searchQuery=chicken+strip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/1a1fdba3-cb82-46ca-8acb-edf0e7ed2027/overview?searchQuery=chicken">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on May 30, 2024.<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Joyce Woods, an RAF friend and volunteer who also facilitates the NM Airstrip Network.</em></p> <p>“Value is Created with Partners” was my new manufacturing boss’s mantra in the 90’s. Inspired to reform our leadership culture, he demanded teamwork from his department heads vs. the typical management style of the time, driven by egos. Previously, I was coached that the way to get things done was to pound your fist on the table. It never seemed right to me.</p> <p>When I first heard rumblings of forming a backcountry group in New Mexico, there was great interest in a closed state-owned airstrip adjacent to a state park. Meetings were arranged to pursue reopening the field that had been X’d out on the charts for many years. Meeting resistance, the bulldog approach was invoked by eager but well-meaning pilots, triggering a Mayor Daley style response by the agency. The field was slashed and removed from the charts. We still dream about access to this and another airfield on land this agency since purchased. If we only knew then, the lessons RAF has taught us.</p> <p>Enthusiastic members of the New Mexico Pilots Association (NMPA) formed a Backcountry Committee in 2009 which immediately benefitted from RAF resources and leadership counsel. The NM Recreational Use Statute was amended.&nbsp; We used the Land Managers Guide and gained support for volunteer efforts at public and private airfields.</p> <p>New Mexico success with USFS airstrips is the result of partnerships established at multiple levels. Relationships developed by John McKenna and Mark Spencer (AZ Liaison) with top Region 3 leadership enabled initial green lights. At the forest level, the friendship developed by Larry Filener and Ron Keller (past and current NM Liaisons) with now retired John Pierson, previously Reserve District Ranger in the Gila National Forest.&nbsp; John, who joined Negrito Airstrip work parties sleeping under the stars with only a bedroll, immediately recognized the value of our team. He bragged on hardworking, resourceful pilots with easy access to remote areas, establishing a sustained partnership.</p> <p>In 2016, the New Mexico Airstrip Network was formalized with an MOU signing and roundtable sharing of each leader’s perspective of mutual benefits. Our 13-member partnership endures despite numerous leadership personnel changes. Besides RAF and NMPA, network partners are BLM, USFS, state agencies (Aviation, Economic Development, Tourism, and State Land Office), AOPA, EAA, USPA, NM Airport Managers, and the NM Council of Outfitters and Guides.</p> <p>Volunteers at annual NMPA/RAF work parties rehabilitated and reopened two USFS abandoned airfields, rebuilt fences and nearby campgrounds, and helped fund and install camping amenities near airstrips including two vault toilets, fire rings, picnic tables, and a shade structure. These and Ron Keller’s leadership for continued NMPA/RAF airfield maintenance support have not gone unnoticed. A recent <a href="https://theraf.org/forest-service-project-demonstrates-value-of-partnership/">USFS news release</a> highlighted the value of this partnership.</p> <p>Working together with the BLM resulted in getting Cuba Landing Strip (NM2) back on the charts. Three new private airfields were charted and another rehabilitated. Working with NM Aviation and Tourism is bringing visibility to the economic value of recreational aviation through fly-ins to rural airports, often paired with a nearby backcountry weekend event. &nbsp;A refueling stop with free lunch for pilots; what’s not to like?</p> <p>Cultivating personal relationships and partnering for mutual benefit is key. We value each airstrip access permission and work party support obtained, and never take a partner relationship for granted. Per John McKenna’s sage advice, we strive to “be polite but persistent”.&nbsp; Demonstrating patience and our commitment to preserve public lands and wildlife, perhaps someday we’ll add new partners and earn access to those currently off-limits airfields.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we enjoy flying the Gila region, a Southwestern New Mexico gem, especially this June as we celebrate 100 years of the Gila Wilderness, the first in the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="613" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0718-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16371 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0718-1.jpg 900w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0718-1-300x204.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0718-1-768x523.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Joyce Woods was introduced to flying by her husband Art.

RAF Utah Liaison and UBCP board member Wendy Lessig has followed the progress of each and urges that your help is needed NOW to preserve many Utah backcountry airstrips. You’ll simply need to click each of the <strong>three</strong> links below and comment on EACH of the three plans.</p> <p>The BLM needs to hear from us what the value and purpose of these airstrips is on public lands. Here are a few talking points that apply to all three BLM Plans.&nbsp;<strong><em>Comment in your own words, and share personal experience you’ve had.</em></strong></p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>Airstrips enable recreationists to enjoy hiking, fishing, camping, backpacking, hunting, and other activities in remote areas that require no road infrastructure;</li> <li>The backcountry pilot community strongly subscribes to the “Tread Lightly” and “Leave No Trace” camping ethic;</li> <li>Remote airstrips need little in the way of resources, and have been enjoyed quietly by many different users for over one hundred years.</li> <li>Aviation has a very small environmental footprint, the lightest footprint form of access to these lands.&nbsp;</li> <li>Airstrips are valuable recreational assets that offer dispersed primitive camping.</li> <li>Aircraft do not have driving wheels and once landed, do not go “off trail.”</li> <li>Noise from aircraft is transient and of short duration.</li> <li>Airstrips are situated on natural flat land features, with little occurrence of soil disturbance or erosion.</li> <li>Airstrips provide vital access to aid Search and Rescue, emergency response, and firefighting.</li> </ul> <p>For more information about BLM Travel Management <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/recreation-programs/travel-and-transportation">click here</a>.

Here you’ll stand on the transcontinental airmail route and one of the concrete directional arrows, a sort of early GPS for early twentieth century pilots. Potato Ridge was dragged, as was McKay Flat, with nearby slot canyons, and a likely glimpse of wild horses.

RAF Pennsylvania/West Virginia Liaison Chip Vignolini tracked progress on the grant and reports that the facility is now functional. Assisted in great part by RAF Supporter Scott White and local volunteers from other aviation groups such as the EAA and Cessna Owners, the 14&#215;18-ft structure has a covered porch, toilets, fiberglas shower enclosures, a mechanical room, and electrical outlets for charging devices near the camping and tie-down area.</p> <p>The airfield owner generously permitted use of his well and septic system at no cost. White made substantial donations to the RAF for this project, and provided many of the tools as did the property owner. Volunteers provided site prep, helped form and pour concrete, and helped on the framing, wiring, plumbing, and roofing. Vignolini reports that volunteers will next install a water storage tank and pump to boost water pressure.</p> <p>Here visitors can experience camping with their airplanes in a peaceful setting with an amazing view and a nice restroom facility and running water for dishes and other needs. There is hiking on site. This remote airfield makes for a great fly-in/fly-out base to explore southern West Virginia. Nearby airports include Summersville Lake (SXL), Raleigh County/Beckley (BKW), and Greenbrier Valley (LWB), home to a historic resort established in 1778.&nbsp;</p> <p>See the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/c83c48be-7abb-4bc5-884a-1a678a14f15a/overview?searchQuery=WV3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>&nbsp;for more information. The owner appreciates a call at&nbsp;704-904-2900 prior to use, but it’s not required.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em><br><em>Submitted May 31, 2024</em></p> <p>##</p> ]]>

Flight Aware’s Dan Baker said their goal isn’t just to display aircraft position, it&#8217;s to make aviation safer, and “get more people to their destinations on time.” Charlie Gregoire of Redbird Simulators said their mission is to keep pilots engaged in aviation long term. Redbird’s new curriculum includes backcountry training. Michael Leek demonstrated the impressive Simuvation mobile flight training studio with Redbird’s RAF-branded full-motion simulator and welcomed conference attendees to experience the sim.</p> <p>Other presentations included the US Forest Service National Dispersed Recreation Program Manager Scott Haas, AOPA President and CEO Mark Baker, Idaho Aviation Association President Andrew George, and Aviat-Husky representatives.</p> <p>In response to the increase in backcountry usage, the RAF has created the Backcountry Etiquette Team, (BET) and they announced upcoming multilateral messaging regarding respectful backcountry flying practices, similar to Tread Lightly!, a new RAF collaborator.</p> <p>The crowd was awed by the reveal of the updated interactive Airfield Guide. “This group encompasses some very deep talent,” RUS Liaison Rick McCraw from Vermont observed.</p> <p>“Sure, we build shelters,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said, adding, “but we build community. And there’s no fence around our community.”</p> <p>Messages poured in afterwards, such as this from Scott and Barbara Heck: “We continue to be amazed at the volunteer efforts and dedication of RAF members, ambassadors, liaisons and board Members. Because of those volunteers, the RAF is able to “put to work” 84% of all donated dollars. Now that is a high bar!”</p> <p>John Meade, RAF New Hampshire Liaison wrote, “This was a very well-prepared conference. Probably the best I have ever attended.”</p> <p>Steve Thompson, RAF Oklahoma Liaison wrote, “I’m humbled by how many people give something to the organization. We gathered a lot of new information from the speakers.”</p> <p>Lisa Ballantyne, who serves as an RAF VP of Appreciation wrote, “The RAF community is built on honesty, authenticity, integrity, and love.” John Whitelaw, Washington State volunteer added, “The RAF is truly blessed with the best!</p> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/948510611/9d72632d5f">See a video of conference highlights here.</a></p> <p>The RAF wholeheartedly thanks these generous sponsors who made this educational conference event a success:<br>Aviat Husky<br>Avidyne<br>Beegles Aircraft<br>Burwell Industries<br>Capital Flight<br>Cirrus Aircraft<br>General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA)<br>Garmin<br>Jet Aviation<br>Lightspeed<br>McKenna Financial<br>Redbird Flight Simulations<br>The Cedar Table</p> <p><em>Submitted June 14, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em><br><em>Photo by Jake Peterson</em></p> ]]>

Powells’ names have been engraved on the list of honorees.</p> <p>In July of 2016, Dave volunteered to serve as the RAF’s first Arkansas Liaison, and his wife Julie handwrites Thank You notes as an RAF Vice President of Appreciation. But that tells only a part of their story.</p> <p>Dave’s passion for aviation runs deep. He started Summit Aviation which operates FBOs, flight training and a Cessna Service Center in Bentonville and Springdale, yet found the time to initiate the RAF mission in his beloved state. Dave was instrumental in building the relationship between the RAF, “Fly Oz” and Arkansas’s chapter of The Nature Conservancy, which led to the successful partnership to turn a hilltop meadow above the Kings River into the beautiful Trigger Gap public-use Airfield.</p> <p>He and Julie have spent countless hours on the ground helping build and improve camping amenities at several turf airfields in the Ozarks.</p> <p>To publicize the joys of accessing these backcountry places, Dave and collaborator Chip Gibbons created the original Airfield Guide, and rolled it out in 2016. The pair spent countless hours on coding and entering data, with a keen eye on accuracy and current conditions.</p> <p>With typical modesty, Julie and Dave accepted the award with tears in their eyes as the crowd gave them both a standing ovation.</p> <p><em>Submitted June 14, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Organized by RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller, RAF and New Mexico Pilots Association volunteers poured the concrete pad for the vault toilet recently, in spite of weather that had prevented a few helpers from making the journey.</p> <p>“A couple of us need to go back in two weeks to finish,” Keller said. Now that the vault toilet is installed, Keller estimates that 20-40 yards of fill dirt will be needed at the site to replace what was used to level the stoop area, and to prevent eventual washout. The crew will install what’s called a VanHorn Roll, designed to minimize erosion between the concrete pad and the dirt or gravel pedestrian approach. The design is named for the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest recreation technician who invented the concept, and is now commonly used throughout Forest Service public camping facilities to preserve ADA access.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="810" height="729" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/setting-forms.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16320" style="width:326px;height:auto" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/setting-forms.jpg 810w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/setting-forms-300x270.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/setting-forms-768x691.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></figure></div> <p>Keller points out that Sacaton offers direct access into the Gila Wilderness. “Pilots who visit have the option of just camping and stargazing, or going for a day hike,” he said.&nbsp;“For the ultra adventurous, an experienced backpacker can hike miles into the Wilderness, and do some fishing. Rain Creek Trail, just northeast of the airstrip is rated moderate to difficult, and is popular for its spectacular scenery,” he added.</p> <p>Anyone wishing to fly in to Sacaton needs to contact USFS Gila Dispatch center,&nbsp;800-538-1644 for permission to land.</p> <p>Find more information in the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/6b52a4ef-4c35-4e11-81b2-43f196218416/overview?searchQuery=Sacaton">Airfield Guide</a>, including a link to the NMPA’s Sacaton safety briefing.</p> <p><em>Submitted on April 29, 2024.<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Seven RAF volunteers&nbsp;from around the country,&nbsp;including Michigan Liaison Rob Aho and Director Jeff Russell from Wisconsin,&nbsp;joined Roseberry and Forestry Technician Katie McCann completing repairs to restore cabin access for users with mobility challenges.&nbsp;Additional work was accomplished at the second USFS cabin on Heckman Lake and the cabin on nearby Jordan Lake.</p> <p>“The teams worked as one integrated group without much distinction between us and them. It was awesome,” DeFreest’s wife Kari said, adding, “We also had great, professional support from our local partner, Misty Fjords Air&nbsp;&amp; Outfitters.&#8221;</p> <p>More effort than expected was required to reposition the dock that had been damaged by ice and forced to a high and dry position down the shoreline. Jeff Russell said, “Seth led the effort with a clear plan, common sense and remarkable bush skills. He came up with the idea to cut and peel hemlocks to skid the floating pier back into the water which was pure bush genius.” DeFreest was equally impressed and added, “Katie was also a joy to work with. Her common sense, demeanor and practical skills were invaluable.”</p> <div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"> <div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1383-1-1-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16429" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1383-1-1-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1383-1-1-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1383-1-1-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure> </div> <div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1363-1-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16430" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1363-1-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1363-1-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1363-1-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure> </div> </div> <p>The workers completed additional maintenance to prepare the cabins for use. “Seth and Katie had done their research on cabin utilization and recent maintenance already accomplished at the old Heckman and Jordan Lake cabins, so that our volunteers&#8217; energy and emphasis could be placed on filling those wood sheds and brushing trails. All told, the RAF was able to help manage not just one, but three cabins in the Naha drainage,” DeFreest added.</p> <p>“I think we made a big impact on the cabins we worked on,&#8217; Russell said.&nbsp;“True to the RAF way of doing things, we had a great time.

Improvements at the parklike airport have been provided by Idaho Aeronautics, Idaho Aviation Association and the RAF. A substantial amount of volunteer work has been, and continues to be provided by the homeowners, in Pryor’s words, “to help this airstrip to be the best it can be,” and the results are impressive.</p> <p>Thanks in part to a second RAF grant that RAF Idaho Liaison Sparky Parker applied for, the runway turf had been analyzed. The grant also helped fund&nbsp;the parts and controls for the irrigation system, grass seed, and twelve tons of fertilizer to improve and stabilize the runway turf.&nbsp;Volunteer Keith Kopf brought the fertilizer to the site, and the homeowners plan to apply it the first of June.&nbsp;Sparky previously applied for and received a grant for fertilizer in 2022.</p> <p>“I managed to fly in on Friday hoping to assist where I could,&#8221; said Steve Johnson, Idaho Ambassador. “I was greeted by a friendly crowd of really capable people. This was an impressive effort in coordination and labor, digging out and replacing 90 plus deeply placed sprinkler connections, all while keeping the runway open. To get it all done in a weekend was really astonishing.”</p> <p>Cavanaugh Bay now has vastly improved amenities for fly-in camping. IAA provided loaner bicycles, Idaho Aeronautics completed major investments in the campground including more tie-downs, interior bathrooms, a new deck, refrigerator, freezer, and covered stainless sink outside for campers’ use, new coffeemaker and better internet; and an outhouse available during the off-season. The local homeowners have invested untold hours of labor, equipment usage and travel and generously invite the public to enjoy the results.&nbsp;</p> <p>For more on Cavanaugh Bay, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;OCiDeuOJMewsGIwVPAkH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Jeanne MacPherson, a longtime RAF supporter. Here is her philosophy on life, and how it relates to flying . . .</em></p> <p>Can we ever become accomplished enough to stop practicing our craft?</p> <p>Pablo Casals was one of the most renowned musicians of the 20th Century. Though he was a brilliant cellist, even in his eighties Casals continued to practice daily. When asked why he kept practicing when he was the best in the world, he replied: “I feel like I am making progress.”</p> <p>This lifetime practice resonates with me in so many things that I love to do. Flying our two airplanes takes constant practice. Sometimes it is one of life’s upsets that forces you into learning and practicing yet again. I recently broke my hip ice skating on Canyon Ferry Reservoir’s wild ice. Daily physical therapy and exercise are now my routine. After a two month break from flying, I am once again practicing landings over and over…looking for that “daily progress.” I have never been comfortable with the saying: “any landing you can walk away from is a good landing.” I believe in striving for excellence.&nbsp;</p> <p>Challenges that I have taken on to improve my ability to land accurately in a stabilized approach at a pre-specified spot are wheel landings in a tailwheel airplane, glassy water landings in a seaplane, short/soft field arrival at a planned spot, touching down on one wheel, and crosswind landings. It is always an ongoing practice.</p> <p>Enhancing aviation skills can be done in many ways and yet made to be fun. One of my favorite approaches to flight reviews is to engage in add-on ratings or specialized flight training.&nbsp; AOPA’s Air Safety Institute offers “focused flight reviews” using tailored lesson plans for mountain flying, positive aircraft control, IFR proficiency, and others. I encourage you to check them out.</p> <p>My husband, Bill, and I like to take on new challenges for our flight reviews. Several years ago, we traveled to the world’s best and friendliest airport in Santa Paula, California, to take Rich Stowell’s Emergency Maneuver Training Course at CP Aviation.

Now, with a renewed sense of purpose, I am practicing landings from the back seat of our Super Decathlon with Bill in the front.&nbsp; I am making daily progress, getting the sight picture and perception from the rear seat so that I once again can be on top of my game as a flight instructor for our granddaughter Graci.</p> <p>The philosopher Seneca said: “As long as you live, keep learning how to live.”&nbsp; I believe that if we follow this advice, we – like Pablo Casals the cellist – can keep making progress as pilots.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:29% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="750" height="728" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4753.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-16229 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4753.jpeg 750w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_4753-300x291.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Jeanne has been a supporter of RAF since it’s inception.

Yet many visitors are unaware there are cabins that can be rented and<br>flown or boated to in the wilderness. Cabin use with road access has increased, but at<br>present the majority of cabins require airplane access, and their preservation is coming<br>under the scrutiny of the USFS.<br><br>RAF Alaska Liaison Jeff DeFreest states the decline in general aviation over the past<br>decades has created a dilemma for USFS recreation managers responsible for their<br>maintenance. “Remote cabins are expensive to maintain, and with diminished<br>government budgets and popular slogans like ‘we need to do more with less,’ it’s easy<br>to see where a Ranger would focus funding toward the close-in cabins, or those<br>accessible by their trucks or boats,” DeFreest says. <br><br>Many of these remote cabins – whether in designated Wilderness or not – provide very<br>unique opportunities for hunting, fishing, hiking, as well as backcountry safety. Those<br>accessed by plane, floatplane or boat provide unique solitude and independence.<br>USFS cabin crews customarily provided annual maintenance and repairs at each cabin,<br>even filling the woodsheds. With ever-tightening budgets, some cabins may not see a<br>USFS cabin crew for three or more years, and deferred maintenance renders the visitor<br>experience less satisfying, leading to diminished appeal and use. <br><br>With the RAF’s formalized collaboration with the USFS, DeFreest expects that<br>disappointing trend to improve. Volunteer labor and cost-sharing agreements can help<br>preserve fly-in cabins. As of this writing, DeFreest and his wife Kari have organized a<br>volunteer work party to maintain two Heckman lakefront cabins.<br><br>The Tongass Forest has published their plan for cabin sustainability. “We’re going to<br>build, relocate, and remove cabins in order to increase public access and use, while<br>reducing costs and avoiding the addition of deferred maintenance on the cabin system,”<br>it states. Usage is key to preservation. The document concludes, “With the goal of<br>increasing visitation and decreasing maintenance costs across the Tongass, annual<br>evaluation of this strategy will be key to demonstrating success.&#8221;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Interior-Alaska-Cabin-Tongass.png" alt="" class="wp-image-16305" width="415" height="310" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Interior-Alaska-Cabin-Tongass.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Interior-Alaska-Cabin-Tongass-300x224.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Interior-Alaska-Cabin-Tongass-768x574.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>The interior of a Tongass National Forest cabin.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>In addition to the willing volunteers that turned out to work at Heckman Lake, a different kind of help is needed. DeFreest advises, “Visit the fly-in lake cabins that offer something of interest to you and then let it be known. Spread the word. Write in the cabin logbook, post on the Tongass Cabin Users Facebook page, and let the Ranger District know about your experience, and communicate any problems or repairs needed that you find.&#8221;</p> <p><em>Submitted on April 24, 2024.</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month’s Featured Airstrip is Childs Glacier, Alaska, where you can hear the glacier groan.</em></p> <p>We know of only one place where you can fly in to a dirt airstrip and set up camp so close to a glacier that RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton says, “You can hear it. It’s always moving.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Childs Glacier airstrip, near Alaska’s famous Copper River, is adjacent to the Copper River US Forest Service campground. You can set your camp chair close enough to the glacier’s glistening face and hear it pop and groan. Clayton reports that in July when the sockeye run is “hot,” this glacier calves icebergs into the river, sending huge waves across it, sometimes washing salmon up into the alder bushes.</p> <p>Thanks to an RAF grant, Clayton assembled volunteers to help the Alaska Trails Crew make the old dirt airstrip usable again. They did&nbsp;five&nbsp;weeks’ worth of grounds work&nbsp;over two summer work seasons, and brushed out and lengthened the&nbsp;sea-level&nbsp;runway to about a thousand feet. “The airfield is open for use for bush aircraft. There&nbsp;remain&nbsp;tall tree hazards. You would want to be a confident, skilled pilot to land here,” he said, adding, “The scenery and topography are stunning. It is truly a world class location.”</p> <p>The region, within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, is as rich in history as it is in scenery. This airstrip lies just north of the 1910 “Million Dollar Bridge” constructed by the Copper River &amp; Northwestern Railroad to provide the first rail access from the tidewater port of Cordova to interior Alaska. The rail line helped tap the incredibly rich Kennicott copper deposit developed with financial support from New York’s Guggenheim and Morgan families. The last ore train trundled over the hazardous tracks in 1938, leaving the right-of-way and the towns of Kennicott and McCarthy to a few hardy residents to fight off the encroaching alder trees.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the 1964 earthquake, the State invested in bridge repairs and the Forest Service built the Copper River campground. But washouts have since destroyed bridges downstream from Million Dollar Bridge. Now the only access is over the treacherous river by riverboat; or this short&nbsp;and challenging&nbsp;airstrip. “It&#8217;s exciting to see this spectacular venue available for public use again,” Clayton added.</p> <p>While you’re in the area, consider a visit upstream to McCarthy. It’s retained its authentic Alaska mining feel, and is small but welcoming, accessible by air into its 3,500-ft gravel airport; or by rough road that follows the old CR&amp;NR grade a couple of hours from Chitina. The road ends at the Kennicott River, where you take the pedestrian/bicycle bridge over the river, a half mile from town. Visitors can take a scheduled shuttle to town, and tours of the Kennicott mine are available seasonally.</p> <p><em>Submitted April 30, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

One is the donor, the second is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 charity like the RAF.</p> <p>This is an irrevocable gift of an asset – typically a highly appreciated, yet previously untaxed one – to a special trust or charitable gift annuity.

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Finley Taylor, an 18 year old commercial pilot and a good friend of the RAF.</em></p> <p>My earliest memories of flying with the RAF are in the back of a Piper Super Cub, staring at the back of my dad’s t-shirt over the picturesque North China Wall in Montana. The thrill of the bouncy tundra tires meeting the soft summer grass on some backcountry strip amazed my young self. I understood at a young age that this hobby would quickly evolve to consume my entire life. I kept flying, graduating to the front seat, and adding more types to my ever-growing logbook. Thanks to the RAF, I logged my first official landing at the age of 13 in a Kodiak with Mark Brown, quickly followed by a Cessna Grand Caravan with Peter Burwell.</p> <p>I continued to fly with my dad, Steve Taylor, at RAF events throughout my childhood. Idaho, Montana, Washington, Vermont, and Michigan are just a few of the states I have experienced incredible backcountry strips that I have had the opportunity to visit. The excitement of travelling to a new place and meeting new people still inspires me to continue my adventures alongside the RAF. From pulling the frozen jeans out of my sleeping bag at Smiley Creek (U87), to making memories with friends at Moose City (86MT).&nbsp; But beyond the incredible places I have visited, I’ve made lifelong friends, learned valuable lessons that have aided me not only as an aviator but also as a person, and enjoyed talking endlessly about airplanes along the way.</p> <p>I still remember my introduction to an RAF staple: The work party. We packed our sleeping bags and tent into the back of our Cessna 180 and flew to Sullivan Lake (09S) where we would camp for a weekend and work to improve the airport. This trip was a microcosm for the greater purpose of the RAF as people bonded over preserving a beautiful airport while enjoying good company, good food, and campfires. As we watched the sunset over the lake, I couldn’t help but to reflect on the sight of dozens of orange RAF hats scattered down the runway, shovels in hand and ready to work. After a long day digging and replacing equipment, we all sat down to a dinner hosted by the gracious Washington State Liaisons, the Whitelaw brothers. The joint work effort and camaraderie over a seemingly dull task opened my eyes to the spirit of the RAF. Flying to spectacular backcountry strips that would’ve otherwise been forgotten, working with other volunteers for the greater good of aviation and to preserve these magical places for generations to come, and to create memories with fellow aviators.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, I found myself at Cavanaugh Bay (66S) surrounded by fellow aviators and RAF enthusiasts to celebrate 20 years of the organization. Again, I was struck by the community and sense of belonging with everyone. As a teenager, I notice my peers having trouble connecting with adults and viewing them as the “others.” I attribute my experiences with the RAF as part of the reason that I proudly call these people my friends as well. Sitting on folding lawn chairs watching airplanes takeoff and land, discussing stories, and sharing laughs with others reminds me why the RAF is so special. The special connection shared between people over a common interest is something that must be cherished. A bright orange RAF hat is a sure sign that you’re about to make a new friend. Later that trip, we flew to Ryan Field (2MT1) to continue our celebrations and admire the newly finished barn. Standing under the beautiful, exposed beams and seeing the care and craftsmanship behind the work reminded me of the hard work and dedication the RAF puts towards preserving and maintaining these beautiful backcountry strips. And yet, it’s the dedication of the volunteers that make these places so special and the RAF such a truly unique organization.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:35% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Finley_Taylor_Headshot-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16119 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Finley Taylor is an 18-year-old commercial pilot from Bellevue, Washington.

There are always new people on their side, but the conversation is relaxed, positive and constructive,” McGlynn said.</p> <p>RAF Chair John McKenna said, “I want to congratulate entire RAF team for all that gets done with this agency [the Forest Service.] Things are continuing to march on.”</p> <p>Penny Wu,&nbsp;new Deputy Director of Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Resources of the Washington, DC office&nbsp;was on the call for the first hour, “which is significant,” McGlynn said. Following is a brief summary of the discussion.</p> <p><strong>Region 1 –</strong>&nbsp;Carol Hennessey, Program Manager for Recreation, Heritage, Wilderness Trails and Volunteer Resources, praised the RAF’s part in the Moose Creek fence project, and for transporting shingles to Shearer. She mentioned that our&nbsp;Great American Outdoors Act&nbsp;Proposal of $640,000 for deferred maintenance of Nez Perce-Clearwater Forest airstrips is in line for approval.&nbsp;Riley brought up Magee, that needs engineering assessment and water mitigation.&nbsp;Carol commented that she may begin to retain funds to take on the Magee project.</p> <p><strong>Region 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong>The work New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller did to open Sacaton Airfield after decades of being closed was praised, as well as Keller’s managing the acquisition and installation of the vault toilet on the Gila Wilderness trailhead using USFS funds.&nbsp;Supervisor Wendy Sutton noted how much faster and easier it is to make projects happen through the RAF partnership.</p> <p>Arizona Liaison Mark Spencer and the Arizona Pilots Association have done maintenance on Double Circle historic ranch and airstrip in the past, but there is degradation of the buildings, and decisions will have to be made what will be done with this historic ranch going forward.</p> <p><strong>Region 4</strong>&nbsp;has the most airstrips, and gets $214,000 of the $750,000 every year. Action includes significant runway work at Mahoney. Soldier Bar and Indian Creek were graded by a contractor. New outhouse at Cabin Creek and new erosion bars at Cold Meadows were discussed. Salmon/Challis is collecting “airstrip use data” across all four of their airstrips.&nbsp;Payette NF cut trees on approach to Johnson Creek. Riley asked that funds be allocated for Hoodoo Meadows, which will have to be included in the next funding round.</p> <p><strong>Region 5</strong> has only two airstrips, Gravelly Valley in Mendocino NF, and now Monache Meadows in Inyo NF. The big news here is that funds will be allocated for Monache and it will reopen in spring 2024 after 13 years of RAF California Liaison Rick Lach’s continuous efforts. Riley is working with RAF volunteer Alan Cossit on reopening a third airstrip, Happy Camp in the Klamath NF.</p> <p><strong>Region 6 –&nbsp;</strong>12 of their 18 backcountry airstrips are located in NE Oregon. Last year almost all the allocated funds were used to gravel the apron at Crescent Lake airstrip in response to the airport’s request. RAF Oregon Liaisons Rick Mayes and Bill Ables will assemble work plans with Challenge Cost shares for other worthy projects in the coming months.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Region 9 –</strong>&nbsp;Most effort has been on Lost Creek. Planning for this year continues with RAF Michigan Liaison General Grant. The permit holder for Bass Creek, the other backcountry airstrip in Region 9, has charted it “R&#8221;. Supervisor Chad Runyan was surprised to learn that someone could permit public land and then privatize it, as this airstrip permittee has done. Runyan will approach the permit holder to see if he&#8217;s willing to make the airstrip public. &nbsp;</p> <p>Runyan also served as our host at AirVenture 2023. He reported that the USFS booth was much improved by the RAF presence and RAF&#8217;s focus on GA recreation on public lands. RAF will be in the USFS booth at AirVenture 2024 in Hangar D. He will also attempt to allocate one forum slot to the RAF during this 2024 event at Oshkosh.</p> <p><strong>Region 10 –</strong>&nbsp;Four of the five airstrips in the Region received maintenance. The Region plans to construct 25 new cabins on lakes in Alaska. RAF Alaska Liaisons Stef Goza and Jeff DeFreest said RAF volunteers are “gearing up to help.” &nbsp;</p> <p>It’s widely understood that the Forest Service must balance varied expectations of differing public user groups. Grazing, resource extraction, recreation, and protecting natural space puts opposing pressures on Forest Service land managers. “The one thing that has become clear to me is that after twenty years, we have accomplished so much more through our gentle nudging, than being the loudest voice in the crowded room of public opinion,” McKenna said. “We’ve proven that the RAF is there to help, back up, pay for stuff, and fly top cover when needed,” he concluded.</p> <p><em>Submitted March 29, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

The airfield, 17A was built in 2016 on Arkansas’ Pension Mountain through the generosity of The Nature Conservancy, and volunteers and funding from the RAF and Fly Oz, as well as The Walton Foundation. Volunteers have completed improvements to 17A since 2016, with shade trees for camping and picnics being the latest.</p> <p>In February, Goodwin had selected and arranged the planting of seven Nuttall Oaks, “substantial trees that will provide beauty and shade for a hundred years.” And the trees needed tending to ensure they’d thrive. Nine volunteers braved March’s wind chill to stake and form water wells for the new trees. They cleared thousands of rocks, smoothed and filled in low spots, spread grass seed, and generally cleaned up the grounds. A team removed a deteriorating picnic table and assembled two new metal ones. “We had a really good time doing it,” Goodwin added.&nbsp;</p> <p>Costs for these improvements have been shared by The Nature Conservancy, the RAF and Fly Oz, as well as The Walton Foundation. RAF Liaison Dave Powell and Goodwin continue to organize RAF and Fly Oz volunteers who maintain and improve the airfield, and&nbsp;Goodwin has taken on the significant task of bringing water to the new trees, now and as the weather warms.</p> <p>For more information on Trigger Gap, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/f6ed09bf-07ec-4302-96c8-9f80743ae0c4/overview?searchQuery=trigger">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="738" data-id="16180" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Trigger-Gap.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16180" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Trigger-Gap.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Trigger-Gap-300x221.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Trigger-Gap-768x567.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="644" data-id="16185" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT06-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16185" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT06-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT06-1-300x193.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT06-1-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> </figure> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="826" height="1000" data-id="16182" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT02.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16182" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT02.jpg 826w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT02-248x300.jpg 248w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT02-768x930.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="840" height="1000" data-id="16184" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT04.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16184" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT04.jpg 840w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT04-252x300.jpg 252w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TGA-WT04-768x914.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure> </figure> <p><em>Submitted March 28, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Based on the design used at the West Yellowstone airport campground with a fire pit inside, it will be located near the existing pilot lobby where there is wifi, outhouse, and water hydrant.&nbsp;Tie-downs will be placed near the pavilion and, “Underwing camping will be encouraged, and night sky viewing would be excellent on clear nights,” Newpower said.&nbsp;</p> <p>St. Ignatius has a tradition of community support for its airport. Its annual EAA pancake breakfast typically hosts over 500 folks. St. Ignatius businessman Mike Kuefler, also an RAF, EAA, and MPA member, is heading up the project, and has commitments from local volunteers, some of whom are donating substantial materials and labor. MPA has contributed funds to the project, as well.</p> <p>The paved airport has fuel and a courtesy car, making it a convenient staging point for Montana’s Bob Marshall Wilderness – only 56 miles from Schafer Meadows – as well as Idaho’s Frank Church, and Selway Wilderness. It’s 80 miles from Moose Creek USFS airstrip.&nbsp;</p> <p>Visitors can stock up on groceries at Stutzman’s Country Market, literally over the airport fence. Other groceries, restaurants, and services are just a short drive to town. The rural roads around the airport are suitable for biking, very near the base of the Mission Mountains and the Mission Mountain Wilderness Area.</p> <p>Other things to do nearby include a driving tour of the 19,000 acre Bison Range with its wide variety of wildlife. The 130-year-old St. Ignatius Mission church is on the National Historic Register, and its exceptional painted murals are well worth viewing. The Ninepipes Museum of Early Montana is just a few miles up Highway 93, with an espresso and gift shop adjacent. A few miles farther north brings you to the Miracle of America Museum, and lakeside town of Polson.</p> <p>“This airport is great for people who prefer pavement but want to be near mountains to get the flavor and feel of the backcountry,” Newpower said, adding, “The mountain scenery is incredible. When you talk to people from the flatlands, this spot is a big deal to them.”</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbry<br>Submitted on February 26, 2024.</em></p> ]]>

RAF Arkansas Liaisons Dave Powell and Harper Goodwin and their wives Julie and Diane have spent a good bit of time working on improvements there, and began taking action to create more shade. “Our long term plan is to let selected volunteer pine trees grow here and there. However, when campers take shelter in the shadow of the pavilion chimney, one starts thinking of a solution,” Goodwin said. He visited nurseries, talked to The Nature Conservancy people and local area ranchers. He met Michael Bays of Instashade who specializes in transporting and planting large trees. They are sourcing trees from what Goodwin calls, “a tree farm that finds itself in the path of urban sprawl. It’s only a matter of time until these trees are replaced by a sea of grey rooftops.” Bays is transplanting these trees at what Goodwin considers a very fair price, funded by a Walton Family Foundation grant.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tree-Planting-Trigger-Gap.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16061" width="309" height="328" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tree-Planting-Trigger-Gap.jpg 943w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tree-Planting-Trigger-Gap-283x300.jpg 283w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tree-Planting-Trigger-Gap-768x814.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></figure></div> <p>Plans to accomplish the transplanting in 2022 were delayed, so the crew started looking at late fall 2023 but rains prevented Bays from accessing the tree farm with his trucks. In February, Harper was able to select seven Nuttall Oaks, “substantial trees that will provide beauty and shade for a hundred years,” he announced.</p> <p>A massive spade accomplished the transplanting over four days. “The distance and hard ground took its toll and a mini excavator had to be rented to complete three of the holes,” Goodwin said.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watering-Trigger-Gap-Trees.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16062" width="331" height="248" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watering-Trigger-Gap-Trees.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watering-Trigger-Gap-Trees-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watering-Trigger-Gap-Trees-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /></figure></div> <p>Next came the obligation to water the trees, about 100 gallons of water each every week now, and throughout summer. “So now I have a 150 gallon collapsable water bag in the back of my pickup,” Goodwin said. He fills it from their well at home, then tops it off a couple of times at a local rancher’s home near the airfield.&nbsp;</p> <p>Always managing maintenance, these volunteers will host a work party to stake the trees, remove rocks, smooth soil, and assemble picnic tables. “Dave and myself are very proud of what has been accomplished here at Trigger Gap,” Goodwin says. “It would not have been possible without the help of The Nature Conservancy, The Walton Foundation, the RAF, Fly OZ and their dedicated volunteers. Come fly in and enjoy the view and now the ever-increasing shade!”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Trigger-Gap-Trees--1024x673.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16106" width="597" height="392"/></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted March 4, 2024 <br>by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Visitors have enjoyed Gillette’s warm hospitality after landing on their 2,400-ft turf airfield at Lakewood Lodge in northern Wisconsin, where Bob and Judy hangar their airplanes. Wisconsin winters don’t slow them down, as they have enjoyed their Maule on skis, and in the past spent time on snowmobiles, snowshoes and cross-country skis.</p> <p>“Now we go north for our winters,” Bob says. North? “About five miles north of the Lodge to our home in town,” Judy adds. They purchased the old Stone Lake fire hall, and turned that drab gray building into their cozy home, installing coffered ceilings and filling it with memorabilia. There’s adequate shop space for Bob to work on his array of vintage autos – more than you can count on both hands. One, a 1960 XK 150S with right hand drive was owned by British actor Trevor Howard. “We like old things,” Bob confesses. Lakewood Lodge is on a gravel road, and Judy explains, “We prefer living in town most of the winter rather than drive on all that gravel. It saves me a lot of polishing.”</p> <p>Judy, originally from Tillamook Oregon, and Bob, a native of Wisconsin, met thanks to their respective careers with United Airlines. Judy had tried office work in Portland after graduating from high school, but says, “Office work wasn’t fun,” so she applied as a flight attendant. “I took Newark, since no one else wanted it,” she added. Bob was a pilot initially based in Chicago, and it was fortuitous for them both when he got tired of digging his car out of snowbanks and bid for Los Angeles, where Judy was then based. They married, and lived for a time on “Blackguard”, the 40-ft Taiwan-built ketch that Bob had bought by then.</p> <p>Ever since taking the stick of a J-3 as a kid, Bob knew he wanted to fly. “I was working nights in the development department for Woodward Governor Company in Rockford, Illinois. I went home, and thought about my friend having hired on at United. I could have just stayed in bed and gotten more sleep. We have chances in life where we come to a fork in the road. So I headed for O’Hare for my interview with United,” he says, and left a job he liked as machinist and lab technician. “In my rush, I forgot to put on a belt, so I spent the whole interview with my stomach sucked in and my suit coat buttoned so they wouldn&#8217;t know I was forgetful. I knew they wouldn&#8217;t want THAT in a pilot!”</p> <p>Bob’s passion for learning and flying led to his 33 year United career with both recip and turbine ratings. He starting as Flight Engineer on the DC6, then Boeing 737 and 720; then First Officer on the 727. He stopped counting after reaching 18,000 hours all over the world. In 2000, he reached the mandatory retirement age of 60, but certainly kept flying. Gillettes have owned a variety of GA aircraft including Bob&#8217;s first, a Piper Vagabond; and more recently, a Luscombe 8A, and one-of a-kind Maule M5-200, still owned by an RAF supporter.</p> <p>Judy earned her private pilot license, and enjoyed flying their Luscombe off their airfield. She retired from United after 32 years, when Bob retired.</p> <p>Gillettes invite folks to come enjoy their facilities on the shore of Loyhead Lake. They added an RV campground in the pine trees with picnic tables, fire ring and electrical hookups. There are tie-downs for airplane camping. They host an&nbsp;annual fly-in and picnic there.&nbsp;The four-day event is an annual gathering of local EAA chapter 631 and RAF friends, and is a leisurely opportunity for folks to gather and spend time together.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20221224_131415-2-1024x928.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16101" width="554" height="503"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bob &amp; Judy&#8217;s Fire Hall House</figcaption></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted March 14, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Christine Mortine, a CFI and an RAF Liaison.</em></p> <p>A Family of Independents, A Community of Joy: </p> <p>If you hang a suet feeder for woodpeckers, use the type with an extender for their tails.&nbsp;Bluebirds and chickadees don’t need it, but the woodpeckers do. I love seeing a Downy swoop in, land, using three points of contact – two feet and a tail – mains and a tailwheel.</p> <p>I connect with woodpeckers, as they are often solo, at the feeder or navigating through the forest. I enjoy flying solo too, especially cross country. A former flight student reached out and asked if he could join me flying from Ohio to Ryan Field, Montana. I didn’t reply right away, and he wisely sent another note saying, ‘What was I thinking! I know you covet alone time in your plane!” Thanks to his follow-up note, we did fly that cross country together. And it was great. Maybe I should do that more often.</p> <p>I see my bird feeders stay unused for hours, then suddenly, like a dinner bell for birds’ ears only, they all come at once. Call me crazy, but I also relate to that as a pilot. We are scattered everywhere and when a fly-in gets organized, we converge all at once. Those are the times lifelong memories are made.</p> <p>While at an RAF Fly-In at Bob and Judy Gillette’s Lakewood Lodge, I declined the gracious offer of a bed in a bedroom in favor of my tent, to their utter surprise. Sleep eluded me that night as I didn’t want to miss a thing in the delicious space away from a city. I was rewarded with a long, melancholy owl duet in the middle of the night, all under a bright full moon. What is it with me and birds?</p> <p>Pilots, by the very nature of the job, are independent. To land in a backcountry field and have all you need for days requires that skill. Herding a bunch of independent types and creating one of the best darn organizations around is just what the RAF has managed to create.</p> <p>I flew two RAF-interested pilots to North Fox Island, 6Y3. Before heading out I called Brad Frederick to check conditions and see if there was anything I could do while there.&nbsp; He said everything was pretty good and to let him know how high the runway turf had gotten. Our trip day arrived, and while flying over the runway for a healthy look, we spied a parked aircraft. I’ll be darned if Brad hadn’t shown up that morning to mow the field for us. That’s the RAF Way.</p> <p>When I needed a new C185 to replace the one that took care of me in an unplanned off-field landing, it didn’t take long for our RAF family to find an amazing replacement, from an amazing RAF member. So “Red Fox” stays in the family. &nbsp;</p> <p>When I was invited to write this piece, a part of me thought I should write about flight instruction and such, as I’m blessed to be serving in that profession. But I keep coming back to the RAF community. Yes, there’s significance in the places we save, news we spread, the safety we promote. But for this solo natured bird, the community is a highlight. A former concert soprano who showed up to rehearsals with no makeup and wearing hiking boots, I am a happy camper in this aviation world, and with the RAF family.</p> <p>I love being a part of our honorable, kind, hard working flock. Unlike our backyard birds, we clean up our messes, leaving a place better than we found it, and with the joy of partnerships flying both near and far!</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_0334.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16006" width="519" height="389" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_0334.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_0334-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_0334-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Josh and Christine celebrate after arriving at Ryan Field from Ohio.</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 46%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Christine Mortine had a twenty-five year career as a classical musician before shifting from conducting instruments to flying by them.

They have fallen victim to deferred maintenance and seasonal damage, and due to limited USFS funding, were in jeopardy of being decommissioned. “Loss of these fly-in, and marine access cabins would result in the loss of a very unique remote recreational experience,” RAF Alaska Liaison Jeff DeFreest said. The one he refers to as SE Heckman is handicap accessible, with floating seaplane dock and ramps to get to the cabin and outhouse.</p> <p>He was awarded an RAF grant for volunteers to clean, preserve, and improve the seaplane dock, ramps, and cabin. “Maintaining this backcountry forest access amenity provides shelter for recreational users, hunters, fisherman, and seaplane pilots, as well as emergency shelter for pilots and other backcountry users who may need shelter in survival circumstances,” DeFreest added.</p> <p>He pointed out that the Heckman Lake cabins are relatively close to town, making them most affordable for people who charter a flight in, and the higher usage increases the likelihood that the USFS will be able to maintain the facility once damage and deferred maintenance are mitigated. DeFreest hopes this project leads to further RAF collaboration with the USFS. “A successful partnership on this entry level project can lead to future projects,” he said, in hopes of preventing the decommissioning of other public use cabins in the Tongass National Forest.</p> <p>DeFreest has scheduled other maintenance, and has organized volunteers to help brush out around cabins and stairs, clean windows, refurbish the original cabin dedication sign and improve fire ring location and install an RAF fire ring.</p> <p><em>Submitted on Febrauary 29, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

They are enthusiastic about promoting and preserving the experience for others who wish to visit the Alaskan wilderness and stay warm, dry and secure for a few dollars a night.&nbsp;</p> <p>DeFreests are sharing some resources beginning with the November-December issue of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaleditions.walsworth.com/publication/?i=810805&amp;p=1&amp;view=issueViewer&amp;pp=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Water&nbsp;Flying</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>On page 5, you’ll find the article on these facilities, and a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://alaskapublicusecabins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>&nbsp;of 122 of the cabins. Originally researched and created by Montana RAF supporter and pilot Tom Bass in his straight-float Cessna 180, pilot Bill Rusk called the directory “an incredible resource,” and was concerned about its future when Mr. Bass retired from&nbsp;flying. The online directory is now managed by the Seaplane Foundation, sponsored in part by the Seaplane Pilots Association, and is administered by Mr. Rusk.&nbsp;</p> <p>DeFreest is concerned that Alaska’s&nbsp;fly-in lake cabins are threatened with decommissioning due to lack of use. He points out that the USFS tracks cabin utilization based on reservations made through the&nbsp;<a href="http://recreation.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recreation.gov</a>&nbsp;website or mobile app.</p> <p>“Awareness and recognition of the cabin system should bolster utilization, and in turn the Forest Service will keep them up,” DeFreest said. He urges pilots to explore the remarkable opportunities to enjoy Alaska, and book accordingly. It is not necessary that you own and&nbsp;fly&nbsp;a seaplane.&nbsp;<em>Water&nbsp;Flying&nbsp;</em>points out that there are other ways to access these gems.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The RAF has been great to agree to help with the cabins and their utilization. They are an incredible resource and the floatplane equivalent of backcountry airstrips. They are the epitome of ‘recreational aviation,’” Mr. Rusk added.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted January 30, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

RAF Maine Liaison Andy Rowe and the Nature Conservancy were notified on January 31 by the FAA that, “Your airport has been created and assigned airport ID: 82ME,” with an effective date of February 22, 2024.</p> <p>Officially called Red Pine Grove, the remote paved airfield lies just a dozen miles from Quebec. Originally built by International Paper as a facility for forest management, it was abandoned and closed decades ago. Recognizing its recreational appeal and in response to wide regional interest in reopening the airport, RAF Liaison John Nadeau initiated dialog with The Nature Conservancy back in 2009. Rowe and fellow Maine Liaison Steve Mason, along with RAF supporter and TNC trustee John Sowles, gathered other volunteers over several work parties and returned the airfield to a safe condition. The RAF signed an agreement with TNC in 2022 to manage it for recreational aviation use. The North Maine Woods organization maintains recreational facilities throughout the northern part of the state, including the camping facilities at Red Pine.</p> <p>Rowe claims good muskie fishing in the Saint John River, colorful fall foliage, and access to good hunting from Red Pine. “Flying in saves hours of driving on logging roads,” he added. Thanks go to Sowles, in-holder Bill Sylvester, Lisa Reese of the Maine Aeronautics Association and her husband, Steve Williams of the Seaplane Pilots Association, “who have been very helpful for over a decade,” Rowe added.</p> <p>For more information and the required Safety Briefing for Red Pine Grove, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;IzRVbeuFFUvaSxxAavNo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rowe pointed out that Estcourt in Aroostook County&nbsp;has also received its FAA identifier, 19ME.&nbsp;Watch for more details on Estcourt, and its addition to the Airfield Guide in the near future.</p> <p><em>Submitted February 12, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Hosted by RAF President Bill McGlynn, it may just inspire you to plan a similar journey – or then again, you may prefer to enjoy this amazing story by your fireplace and just hit “Replay.”</p> <p>In spite of a first-day blizzard delay and winter’s short daylight, Jeff packed his SuperCub on skis and headed north. Crossing into Canada from International Falls – often our nation’s coldest place – his crossing was “painless,” then he arrived in Yorktown, Saskatchewan at negative 35º. “There was a cold front, and I found it,” Jeff said, adding, “That’s where two-inch blue painters’ tape comes in. I’d take off and tape myself in to seal any place where cold air came in.” Of course, that didn’t keep the drinks in his back seat from freezing solid.&nbsp;</p> <p>Connecting through his long-time membership in&nbsp;<a href="http://supercub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SuperCub.org</a>&nbsp;and RAF friends, Jeff found very helpful folks that hosted and coached him throughout his trip. Dreading the possibility of hand-propping his plane, he’d call ahead to be sure there was fuel, a place to plug in his engine heater each night, and often &nbsp;an available hangar.</p> <p>Mornings brought magical mountain sunrises. “I was giddy. The beauty was overwhelming,” he said. His partner Rhonda flew commercially to join him in Anchorage to experience the race. On their return flight early season forest fires threatened their safety.</p> <p>To learn the other challenges and how Jeff overcame them, and an intimate glimpse into race life and the mushers’ dedication to their dogs, listen to this fascinating 55-minute story!</p> <p>Find the podcast&nbsp;<a href="https://theraf.org/raf-podcast-13-epic-winter-trip-to-the-iditarod-with-jeff-russell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, or anyplace you find yours.</p> <p><em>Submitted January 30, 2024</em><br><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

After high school, Chris took after his father in the utility power line trade and now owns a power line construction company that he started with his father who has since retired. Chris has always had a vast interest in aviation, and during his youth had a large collection of RC airplanes. In 2019 at the age of 47, he received his private pilot license – his seaplane rating and tailwheel endorsement soon followed.</p> <p>Chris has been flying a 1942 Aeronca Super Chief Seaplane and recently completed a three-plus year total overhaul of a Cessna L-19 Birddog along with his IA. &#8220;The project started with only the firewall in a jig, and the rest of the airplane built new around it,” he says. It has many performance upgrades and is rigged for wheels, skis and amphibious floats. “The lovable ‘one niner’ (L-19) turned into a bucket list item that I didn’t know I wanted,” Chis added. “I swear that I didn’t have the RAF in mind for the color scheme. My wife Diane picked out the colors for it.”</p> <p>While still a student pilot owning a Piper Cherokee, Chris had hopes of building a hangar at Charles A. Chase Jr. Memorial Field, (44B) a 3,000-ft grass strip in his hometown. The airport was named for Charles A. Chase Jr. who was tragically killed in December of 1959 while flying his Cub dressed as Santa. The Chase family gifted the airfield to the people of Dover Foxcroft but neglected to stipulate that it remain an airfield in perpetuity.</p> <p>When Chris learned that the town manager and board had plans to close the airport for a solar power generation farm, he joined the dedicated group of individuals who formed the Save the Charles A. Chase Jr. Memorial Facebook page. It attracted 1,000 followers along with much of the town, as well as Chase family members determined to save the airport. “The town manager was one postage stamp away from sending the paperwork to the FAA to shut down the runway when this all started,” Chris says. He was introduced to the RAF. Together with the support of RAF supporters Steve Mason, John Meade, Rene Robillard, and Andy Rowe. Wearing their signature orange, they attended public meetings along with townspeople and Chase family members. The town manager and board of selectmen decided not to close the airport. “The airport is now doing well with three new hangars that have been built since I built mine,” Chris said.</p> <p>Chris is heavily involved with the charitable organization “Wings for Wishes” that benefits the Make A Wish Maine Foundation which raised over $60,000 in 2023. Wings for Wishes is held each August and brings people together from all over the country to a private airfield in Exeter, Maine. “We eat, laugh, fly, and enjoy each other’s company for a few days but most importantly, we raise money to put smiles on the faces of kids and families who might not have that opportunity without the help of Make A Wish,” he says.</p> <p>“The RAF has been a big part of my aviation background already, and I have been lucky enough to meet so many great people in the organization. I look forward to seeing more good things we can do to help create, maintain and preserve backcountry aviation!<br><br>207-852-1881<br><a href="mailto:carno@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carno@theraf.org</a></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by John Sowles, a longtime pilot and RAF Supporter from Maine.</em></p> <p><strong>Bridging the Conservation Divide</strong>:</p> <p>I’m neither the owner or CEO of a major aviation manufacturer nor a 10,000 hour bush pilot. But I do want to share my experience assisting the RAF in opening up a remote airstrip in the North Maine woods. Hopefully, it will help others as we try to save access to a dwindling number of airstrips.</p> <p>The RAF is remarkable in many ways; it was born of an audacious idea by a bunch of bold risk takers over a coast-to-coast geography, negotiating with government bureaucracies, private property owners and environmental/conservation organizations. Objectively, I’d say they were a bit short of furnishings “upstairs”. But look at what they have accomplished!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>My introduction to the RAF began soon after its founding at a dinner with a group of local pilot friends – Steve Williams, Lisa Reese, and Maine Liaison Andy Rowe – where the McKennas explained their vision and goals. At that point in my life, most of my flying had been on floats collecting samples for the State from waterbodies that were difficult to access by truck. I really enjoyed and appreciated getting away to remote areas and relying on nobody but myself. I had never given it a thought that land-based airstrips could provide a similar sense of independence, self-reliance, and peacefulness as the ponds, lakes and rivers I visited. The possibility of a land-based experience intrigued me and I became involved.</p> <p>Right off the bat, I was afforded a front row seat on a long journey with RAF as we worked to reopen an abandoned airstrip in northern Maine. From the mid ‘60s and into the 80s, Maine’s north woods was hit with a spruce budworm infestation that destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of wood having widespread negative impact on the economy of Maine. To combat the budworm, International Paper and the Maine Forest Service built a 3,200-ft paved airstrip to handle converted WWII bomber spray planes.</p> <p>After the budworm infestation passed, Red Pine Airfield was abandoned. Its location adjacent to the St. John River made for a popular camping spot for canoeists and hunters. In 1998, as part of a large land conservation deal, ownership of Red Pine passed to The Nature Conservancy. For liability reasons, the strip was X’ed out. Camping and land-based vehicle access remained.</p> <p>At that fateful dinner, it leaked out that I happened to be a Trustee of the TNC in Maine. “Could I help?” Soon I found myself in an awkward position between two organizations that on first glance might appear in conflict. At the time, conservation organizations were not especially known for opening access, much less motorized access. But Red Pine had been used for recreation for decades by locals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When TNC ‘X’ed it out, it left a bitter taste with locals at a time when organizations like TNC were trying to repair community relations. Upon closer look, the RAF and TNC hold a lot in common. Both believe in supporting communities while achieving their mission. In TNC’s case, much of their land is open to commercial harvest, hunting and fishing, thereby supporting local economies. In RAF’s case, RAF provides&nbsp;stewardship&nbsp;value to the property owner.&nbsp;In this way we indirectly serve the non-aviation communities as well. Both organizations are respectful. Both seek ways to collaborate. Both are committed to conserving natural area experience. And both appreciate local community values.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Because TNC looked at the airfield as a potential attractive nuisance and liability, RAF made the case that we could manage that risk while benefiting a wide constituency. And through gentle conversation, I think we changed the balance sheet from negative perceptions of aviation to positive. Helpful in our conversations were the RAF&nbsp;Code of Ethics, data showing the comparable environmental impacts of aircraft vs land-vehicles, enabling TNC staff to access their property more frequently, ensuring a &nbsp;landing area for emergency evacuations in a remote area of the state, as well as for pilots transiting a large tract of unoccupied forest. We also were willing to concede about 700 feet by shortening the runway so that it would not infringe on the river protection corridor.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>I’ve always believed that people can’t appreciate places if they are locked out. By being present and maintaining a clean and safe area, Red Pine can continue as a critical low impact asset for pilots and many other recreationalists. I want to acknowledge Andy Rowe, Steve Mason and Bill Sylvester as partners in this journey and Steve Williams and Lisa Reese for that dinner so many years ago. They, along with TNC staff, were a pleasure to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>My “take aways” are three:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li>What the RAF does and how it does it is its secret to success. It requires a clear vision that provides benefits&nbsp;<em>beyond&nbsp;</em>RAF directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>The RAF does it by being supportive and respectful rather than confrontational; listening to and addressing landowner concerns and supplying facts and rational positions, and&nbsp;</li> <li>Patience, LOADS of patience and perseverance. Finally, after over 12 years of work, Red Pine reopened in 2021.</li> </ol> <p>In closing, I believe that for all you out there who think you can’t make a difference, think again. We all have something to offer.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:45% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7612.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-15792 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7612.jpeg 640w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7612-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>John Sowles flies a Cessna 170, a Champ, and a TaylorCraft.

It is a desirable recreational destination that provides walking access to Noble County’s Wolf Run State Park campground. Pilots can tie down and follow a wooded trail to the lake. The outhouse was improved, and carts were obtained for visitors to haul camping gear from their parked aircraft to the camping area. Re-grading and drainage of the additional parking area is underway. A visitor sign-in box was added to record pilot usage. During the summer months 10-25 sign-ins are recorded each month. Mortine monitors the record and says, “Heartwarming messages from campers and picnickers sharing their enjoyment of the spot and their plans to return, only make these approved improvements all the more exciting.”</p> <p>Mortine will use the 2024 grant to enlist volunteers to work under the direction of airport manager Ed Crock, who operates a construction company. “The Wolf Run Fly In camp area has proven to be a highly energized project with mounting support and enthusiasm for Phase Two,” Mortine said. Planned improvements include an open-air pilot shelter with concrete floor large enough for several picnic tables, and adequate storage for carts, kayaks, paddles, life jackets, and bikes. The plan is to add an RAF fire ring, and at least three wooden tent platforms closer to the lake’s edge within the more wooded environment.</p> <p>“There is full throttle involvement of the Noble County Board of Trustees, Ohio Department of Natural Resource State Parks division, and the RAF,” Mortine added.

The RAF continues to provide grant funds toward projects, with a second grant&nbsp;of approximately $10,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Parker points out that Idaho Aeronautics has completed major investments in the airport campground including more tie-downs, interior bathrooms, a new deck, refrigerator, freezer, and covered stainless sink outside for campers’ use, new coffeemaker and better internet; and an outhouse available during the off-season. Local homeowners, headed up by full-time Cavanaugh Bay resident Steve Pryor, had pitched in many volunteer days providing substantial maintenance on the airfield. Pryor is donating steel for steps up the steep rise to the campground. Idaho Aviation Association donated bicycles, stored in a shed within the camping area. They are free for pilots to use, but donations are encouraged. There are courtesy cars.</p> <p>Pryor said, “I have volunteered myself to help this airstrip to be the best it can be,” and to that end he arranged for a technician who donated soil testing to see why the grass was patchy. The analysis showed deficiencies, and in the spring of 2022, the RAF granted $1,200 for fertilizer. Several homeowners applied it. That summer, homeowner volunteers used Pryor’s 45-foot bucket truck and trimmed overgrowing trees along the runway. Idaho Department of Lands did some selective logging, and volunteers from IAA and the homeowners group cleaned up leftovers.</p> <p>After experimental irrigation all season, the fertilization and irrigation needs were clarified. Pryor contacted Rain Bird sprinklers and a test of the existing pump demonstrated that there was adequate pressure to operate all 91 sprinklers simultaneously. The 2024 RAF grant will provide the parts and controls for an irrigation system, fertilizer, grass seed, and chemicals to improve and stabilize the runway turf.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Cavanaugh Bay Homeowners lent the use of their high-powered thatcher for Pryor to operate over the runway, for better fertilizer penetration into the soil. This annual process will augment the aeration that Idaho Aviation conducts each year.&nbsp;Parker encourages visitors to enjoy all the new improvements that Idaho Aeronautics recently completed. The volunteers have permission to remove small trees between the campground and airstrip, “so you’ll be able to watch airplanes land while from the campground,”&nbsp;Pryor&nbsp;said. “As you can see, great things are happening to Cavanaugh Bay and it is my goal with the help of the RAF to make it the Johnson Creek of Northern Idaho,”&nbsp;Pryor&nbsp;added.</p> <p><em>Submitted February 14, 2024<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller organized volunteers for a series of work parties that resulted in reestablishment of the long-abandoned runway, and installation of a new vault toilet there, which also benefits Rain Creek Trail hikers.</p> <p>Gila National Forest Supervisor Camille Howes is quoted as saying, “The Recreational Aviation Foundation has been a wonderful partner that is helping to improve and maintain backcountry airstrips across the Gila National Forest. Without their volunteers’ commitment and enthusiasm, Sacaton Airstrip would still be but a memory. This partnership helps secure the future of recreational aviation access on the Gila National Forest.”</p> <p>Beginning in 2010 with Negrito airstrip, RAF and New Mexico Pilots Association volunteers worked on improvements under the direction of then-Reserve District Ranger John Pierson. The New Mexico Airstrip Network was formed to coordinate interested parties and land managers, and annual work parties followed to install windsocks, clear rocks and brush, and improve fences. “Our goal is to maintain the Gila airstrips in good condition so that they may be used for fire suppression, emergency medical evacuation, as well as recreational access,” Keller said. “It was Larry Filener and Mark Spencer who originally joined the District Ranger at Sacaton to look it over. I give great credit to Larry and Mark who had the vision and wisdom to recognize its potential,” Keller added.&nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF and Gila National Forest entered into an agreement in September 2022 to maintain and improve all six of its backcountry airstrips. In addition to Sacaton, they are Beaverhead, Jewett Mesa, Me-Own, Negrito, and Rainy Mesa. RAF volunteers were consulted to help prepare operational standards and a joint operation, maintenance, and inspection plan to ensure ongoing maintenance for these Gila airstrips. The RAF had been successful getting the Forest Service to allocate funds for backcountry airstrips, amounting to $750,000 annually. In 2023, the Southwestern Region received $161,731 for the RAF/Gila cost share challenge, in which the RAF participates by providing services.</p> <p>“The process leading to this success really is a template for further projects. We look forward to partnering with the Forest Service to bring more improvements in the name of respectful and safe aviation access,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said.</p> <p>The Forest Service acknowledges that backcountry&nbsp;airstrips are an important part of the administrative and recreational infrastructure, providing low impact access to national forests. Sacaton is marked “Private” on charts, so pilots should call Gila Dispatch at 800-538-1644 for permission to land, and current airstrip conditions.

Access to Dug Bar is easiest by aircraft, jet boat, “Or you can arrive there after a two-hour drive on a primitive road from the town of Imnaha, Oregon,” RAF Oregon Liaison Bill Ables says. Ables also serves as co-chair of Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative (HCRC), the group of rafters, jet boaters, aviators, motorized recreationalists, commercial outfitters, backcountry horsemen, citizens-at-large, and local government. Its goal is to work with the USFS maintaining safe access as well as providing maintenance for facilities located within the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.</p> <p>Ables has been awarded an RAF grant to purchase a four-wheeler and trailer for maintenance of the turf airstrip and camping area. “This grant is to assist the USFS at no cost to them, by providing volunteers the proper equipment for needed maintenance at this historic and current administrative site,” he explains. “Good bass fishing, (with an Oregon fishing license), upland gamebird and deer hunting is par at this location,” he claims, with the knowledge he gained as a career fish and game warden. There is a windsock, picnic table, and USFS vault toilet on site.</p> <p>Dug Bar has received upgrades thanks to volunteers from the RAF, Oregon Pilot Association, HCRC and Idaho Aviation Association, in part funded with the federal monies allocated for airstrip maintenance. With USFS monies, in 2022, IAA volunteers installed two webcams and a weather station at a private cabin just a half mile down river from Dug Bar.<br><br>The four-wheeler and trailer will be used to transport volunteers and their equipment to and from the boat ramp and aircraft tie down area; and can pull a pasture harrow to smooth the airstrip which is frequented by horses, mules and cattle, and will be used to spray weeds, “and other tasks at this off-the-grid site,” Ables said.&nbsp;“This project is wrapped around the idea that it will allow volunteers the opportunity to enjoy this facility while using their skills to provide maintenance and TLC so to keep this national treasure from disappearing,” Ables added.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray<br>Posted January 15, 2024</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Roy Evans II, the President of Utah Back Country Pilot</em>s <em>Association. </em></p> <p>Throughout my journey in aviation, I’ve been guided by many mentors. In my adolescence, I found myself taxiing across a spacious apron following the tire tracks of countless flight students like me. Immediately my instructor slammed the brakes, turned towards me in the tight confines of that Cessna 152 and asked me, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I quickly replied, “I want to be a professional pilot.” Twice as fast as I had replied, my instructor said, “Then start right now and get on the yellow line.”</p> <p>The benefits of an active, engaging mentor/mentee relationship are often overlooked. Our modern, connected lives rarely find time for the peace and solace many of us find while flying and enjoying the backcountry.</p> <p>In the state of Utah, we are the benefactors of the exemplary stewardship of recreational aviators who enjoy our historic, unparalleled backcountry. When two members of the Utah Back Country Pilots Association were out enjoying a fair weather day and landed at an airstrip they were met by park rangers. When questioned about pilots’ rights in landing at this airstrip, their true professionalism shone. What transpired over those tense moments for these two became the foundation that our organization has been striving for. Their innate stewardship for aviation’s access to our public lands made the impossible happen. Utah’s first airstrip located in a state park, Temple Mountain, once on the chopping block of existence, now thrives as an airstrip with access to Goblin Valley State Park.&nbsp;</p> <p>Etiquette and customs traverse generations — not in books or signs — but in actions. Each time we roll our tires in the backcountry, our impacts on the future of recreational aviation are felt across the world. Learning more about how we can turn our errant marks into positive impressions lies in our individual efforts to engage with those who’ve made this all possible, and the organizations that perpetuate those impressions to the impressionable. Whether it be your membership dues, your participation in work parties and public comment periods, many times a simple email or phone call can bridge the gaps our adversaries exploit in restricting or removing one of America’s greatest freedoms.&nbsp;</p> <p>While we all will find ourselves straying from the yellow lines from time to time, it’s important to surround ourselves with those with the passion to help us steer back on course. Organizations such as the UBCP, Idaho Aviation Association, Montana Pilots Association, and RAF are chock full of mentors looking for ways to help preserve and protect backcountry flying, and I know they would love an extra set of hands. During this winter season, while many of us wait for the snow and the skies to clear, let’s take this time to engage with our local aviation community. Find a mentor who will empower you to continue to make better aeronautical decisions; and prepare ourselves to serve in a similar role. Start making better decisions today that will provide even more opportunities for recreational aviation in the future, and find joy in keeping the dreams of backcountry flying alive.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-bottom" style="grid-template-columns:auto 39%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Roy&nbsp;Evans&nbsp;II has been flying airplanes since he was eight years old.

<![CDATA[ <p>T<em>he RAF is fortunate to have a deep bench of talent. This article is written by CPA Bruce “Sparky” Parker, who volunteers as the RAF Idaho Liaison.</em></p> <p><em>Here Sparky shares some beneficial year-end tax planning/donation strategies to think about. These ideas will work for any of your favorite charities. If you wish to include the RAF, we are standing by to help.</em></p> <p><strong>Get the Best Benefit from Charitable Donations</strong><br>For tax year 2023 the federal standard deduction is $27,700 for married couples and $13,850 for single filers. Many people don’t have enough itemized deductions to top those thresholds and get any tax advantage for their charitable donations. Here are some alternatives to get tax benefits from your donations. <br><br><strong>The “Double Dip” tax benefit</strong><br>Donating appreciated assets that have unrecognized taxable gains, such as publicly traded stocks, can be a tax efficient strategy. You don’t have to recognize the taxable gain. If you are able to itemize deductions, you can deduct the fair market value of the stocks you donate, regardless of your cost basis. This effectively results in a double dip tax benefit. <br><br><strong>Get a tax benefit even if you don’t itemize</strong> <br>If you are 73 years or older and have an IRA, you are most likely required to take taxable distributions each year. Making a “Qualified Charitable Distribution” out of your IRA account(s) to eligible charities, satisfies part of your required annual minimum distribution, while excluding that amount from taxable income. You get a tax benefit even if you don’t itemize. <br><br><strong>Use your IRA to reduce your Medicare premium</strong><br>By donating directly to the charity from your IRA, your AGI is lower which could reduce your Medicare premium adjustment.<br><br><strong>Qualify for Itemized Deduction benefits</strong><br>If you are close to but below the standard deduction threshold, consider skipping charitable donations in a year, then double your donations the succeeding year, thereby exceeding the standard deduction every other year. <br><br><strong>Employer Match doubles your donation</strong><br>Many employers have matching charitable gift programs. Check with yours to see if it is available for you. <br><br>Ask your tax professional or financial advisor about these strategies to ensure they meet your individual financial and charitable goals.<br><br><a href="https://theraf.org/bruce-sparky-parker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce &#8216;Sparky&#8217; Parker, CPA</a><br><a href="mailto:bparker@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bparker@theraf.org</a></p> ]]>

Their families were in the logging business, where Becki “Pete” and Dan picked up their work ethic and resourcefulness. Dan absorbed an acute interest in mechanical things, and learned equipment skills essential in the woods.</p> <p>They share a passion for the outdoors and enjoy camping, hiking, fishing, and did a lot of cross-country touring on their Harley. A head-on encounter with a deer resulted in eight broken ribs for Dan.&nbsp;“We got banged up pretty bad,” he said. The accident was clearly a sign to find a safer form of recreational travel.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Normandeaus never intended to become pilots. Dan, at age 50, thought he was too old to take up flying. He was having lunch with some local pilots, one of whom was easily in his eighties. “The fella told me that I’d only have thirty years of flying ahead of me, so I came home and told Pete I was going to buy an airplane.” For the same price they’d have paid for a new Harley, they bought a Pietenpol Air Camper. Dan started taking lessons in the two-seat open cockpit homebuilt in November. “My flight instructor was frozen. He was pretty motivated to solo me.”</p> <p>They acquired a yellow PA 11, and a red and white PA 18. Pete wanted to be a safe backup pilot, so she got her private pilot license, and enjoys flying both aircraft. Dan was eager to try flying into the backcountry, but was appropriately wary. He’d read all the warnings. “I took my dad into Moose Creek in Idaho. I was still fairly green. My heart was racing a hundred miles an hour. We landed and I said, ‘This is fun!’ ”</p> <p>The Normandeaus enjoy flying and landing in the backcountry throughout the West – Washington State, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, and Colorado. Pete’s son lives in Grand Junction, and they fly there. “We’ve landed at Leadville, the highest public use airport in North America,” Pete adds. Their blue heeler wears a “thunder shirt” and rides tandem behind them. When the mission requires, they each fly one of the Cubs. “Between the two of us, we have that Cessna 180,” Dan jokes. “It just takes two planes for us to haul passengers and camping gear.”</p> <p>“Friends give us a hard time about our slow pace,” Pete says, but she replies, “We’re never in a hurry.”</p> <p>Pete and Dan were camping at Moose Creek and met RAF President Bill McGlynn, who explained the RAF mission and invited them to the Ryan Fly-in the following weekend. “Planes were lined up all along that nice airfield, and we met the best people,” Dan said. When John McKenna learned the Normandeaus had dump trucks, an excavator, Cat, and trailers, he got them involved in all the renovation at Ryan Field. “It was quite the adventure — at first I wondered ‘What did I get myself into?’ We got treated great, and have ever since. We really like the RAF mission. It’s our cup of tea,” Dan says. They’ve pitched in at nearly every work party there since.</p> <p>When they’re not flying, Dan and Pete enjoy touring the nation in their restored 1930 Model A Sedan. “Our first adventure in it was driving to Pikes Peak – a higher elevation that we’ve taken our planes,” Pete says.</p> <p>You may spot Pete and Dan adventure touring scenic byways or backcountry airstrips in their pristine Ford, or one or both of their fetching Cubs. It should be no problem catching up to thank them for all they’ve contributed to the RAF mission.</p> <p><em>Submitted on December 14, 2023<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Chip’s interest in aviation began while living on March Airforce Base in Riverside, CA, with hearing B52s flying overhead. He has pictures of himself flying control-line models in the desert with his dad.</p> <p>Chip completed a Professional Pilot Program in community college and started flying in 1989. At age 19, in 1990, he earned his private pilot license. “Aviation jobs were limited in the early 90’s, so I transferred to West Virginia University in Morgantown where I earned a BS in Wildlife Biology,” Chip explains. He then earned his Executive MBA from Colorado Technical University, and has been an engineer for a major wireless provider for 24 years, holding various leadership roles. His team engineers network infrastructure across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p> <p>Focusing on building his career and a family, he set flying aside until 2009 when he again immersed himself in aviation. “I average 100-plus flying hours a year, have my seaplane rating and tailwheel endorsement,” he says. He flies a variety of singles in his flying club based at his home airfield, Zelienople, PA, where he serves on the Condor Aero Club as Director of Maintenance, responsible for all coordination of maintenance across the entire fleet. Chip is a Field Director for the Seaplane Pilots Association, and is FAA Drone Certified. While involved in RC aircraft, he competed internationally with gliders and precision aerobatics. “I also designed, kitted, and sold a hand-launch glider called the Ariel,” he adds.</p> <p>Chip is dedicated to charitable service, and is a VP on the Pennsylvania Wireless Association board, and sits on its Foundation Board. “Our primary goals are fundraising events for charities such as Homes for Our Troops and wireless industry education,” he says.</p> <p>“I have a passion for aviation and the outdoors. I spend most weekends flying to events nationwide, camping, and finding a stream or lake to wet a line,” he says. He also likes to ride motorcycles, golf, hunt, fish, travel, and snow ski, yet finds time to do all his own work on vehicles and home improvements.&nbsp;“I love being a part of the RAF. This organization is amazing. It’s structured, we have responsibilities. Not to mention it fits into all my interests perfectly,” Chip adds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chip can be reached at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cvignolini@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cvignolini@theraf.org</a></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Nicolas Chabbert, the Senior Vice President of Daher&#8217;s Aircraft Division and CEO of DAHER Aircraft, Inc and Kodiak Aircraft, Inc. </em></p> <p>As the world’s oldest airplane manufacturer in continuous production today – and a family-owned company – it’s no surprise that Daher is proud to be a supporter of the Recreational Aviation Foundation. We share a common vision of conserving and maintaining backcountry airstrips, which is best summarized by the motto: “Daher cares for those who care for aviation.”</p> <p>Building on this strong “aviator DNA,” we have actively backed the RAF for many years, being even more uniquely positioned as a Foundation supporter since our company’s 2019 acquisition of the Kodiak aircraft product line.</p> <p>The Kodiak is truly at home in the backcountry, based on its roots as a rugged STOL airplane that was developed for humanitarian missions into some of the world’s most remote and challenging locations. The cornerstone Kodiak 100 version is a common sight at backcountry strips, and we launched the larger, faster Kodiak 900 version in 2022 as the next step in Daher’s approach to the continual improvement of our turboprop-powered airplane families.</p> <p>With the Kodiak now fully integrated into Daher’s aircraft portfolio, we’ve stepped up our contributions to the RAF’s goals. Earlier this year, we provided a Kodiak 900 to assist U.S. Forest Service personnel in accessing two isolated grass strips in the mountains of southeastern Idaho. Pilots and employees from our Kodiak Aircraft Company joined with the USFS for the airlift of building materials and support equipment to Moose Creek (1U1) and Shearer (2U5), utilizing the Kodiak 900 prototype.</p> <p>These two isolated and unimproved strips are very difficult to reach, with high mountains and the nearest roads being more than 19 miles away – normally requiring pack animals for resupply of any kind. In the past, USFS rangers were based at the locations, but years of budget constraints creates challenges for the government agency in maintaining and supporting its sites. Using the Kodiak 900’s superior cabin size and excellent cargo-carrying capability, the USFS was able to accomplish maintenance for these airstrips and their structures, along with other support duties.</p> <p>For me, the flights into Moose Creek and Shearer are perfect examples of what the RAF and its network of supporters can do to meet the Foundation’s goal of preserving backcountry airstrips and highlighting their true value as a national resource. This also is why we chose to highlight the RAF on Daher’s exhibit stand during EAA AirVenture at Oshkosh, Wisconsin – positioning a Kodiak 100 with the Foundation’s logos next to a high-vis RAF tent, becoming a center of attraction for some of the 677,000 attendees at the 2023 annual fly-in.</p> <p>Another important action that Daher supported this year was the delivery of critical care defibrillators to backcountry strips across the state of Idaho. In coordination with the Backcountry Aviation Defibrillator Project, we provided two Kodiak 100s – along with pilots, fuel and logistics assistance – to deploy the automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at four airstrips, with one of the AED units sponsored by Daher.</p> <p>The Kodiak’s exceptional STOL characteristics were demonstrated once again during these flights, performed to Cavanaugh Bay (66S) in northern Idaho – which is not far from Daher’s Kodiak production facility and final assembly line at Sandpoint; to Big Creek (U60) and Johnson Creek (3U2) in the state’s central portion; and to Smiley Creek (U87) in south-central Idaho.</p> <p>These missions help fulfill the Backcountry Aviation Defibrillator Project’s goal of positioning AEDs at high-traffic remote airstrips by deploying ZOLL 3 units that communicate via Wi-Fi to display their operational status. It enables the transmission of vital data in critical situations when seconds can literally make a life-saving difference. In the future, the defibrillators are expected to broadcast their availability and status using flight planning applications. The AEDs are acquired through donations to The Gem State Aviation Fund, a 501(c) (3) corporation that promotes aviation-related charitable and educational activities, primarily within the state of Idaho.</p> <p>Daher truly values its relationships with organizations such as the RAF and the Backcountry Aviation Defibrillator Project, living up to our commitment in “caring for those who care for aviation.”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15533" width="442" height="479" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo1-1.jpg 750w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo1-1-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Support equipment and building materials were delivered by the Kodiak 900 to Moose Creek (1U1) and Shearer (2U5) during Daher-supported RAF missions for the U.S. Forest Service.</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15535" width="644" height="369" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo2.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo2-300x172.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo2-768x441.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Kodiak 100 exhibited by Daher at EAA AirVenture included the RAF’s logos and a high-visibility tent.</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo3-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15537" width="629" height="354" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo3-1.jpg 631w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo3-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A Daher Kodiak 100 takes off from Johnson Creek (3U2) to complete one of the company-sponsored defibrillator deployment flights in coordination with the Backcountry Aviation Defibrillator Project.</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15536" width="608" height="444" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo4.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo4-300x219.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RAF-editorial-Chabbert-photo4-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Delivering the Daher-sponsored ZOLL 3 defibrillator to Cavanaugh Bay with the Kodiak 100 were: Nicolas Chabbert, Senior Vice President of Daher’s Aircraft Division and CEO of Kodiak Aircraft (second from left); with David Schuck, Senior Advisor at Kodiak Aircraft (at left).

With the good turnout and collective efforts, two days of work was done in one,” Goodwin said. “It was a perfect Ozark fall day which saw a good bit of traffic fly in and out, including a group of Stinsons,” he added.</p> <p>Trigger Gap Airfield is located on The Nature Conservancy land. “We feel that this and other positive RAF projects will strengthen our relationship with TNC. We are also very focused on neighborhood support, which overall has been outstanding,” Goodwin said.</p> <p>Volunteers repositioned the existing gate and fence, and constructed other fencing to provide for a viewing area for spectators. Walkthrough access was provided to the airfield, and the gate has a combination lock which limits drive through access.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the viewing area, volunteers constructed a traffic pattern indicator around the windsock, and built two firewood storage racks and stocked them with firewood they’d cut and split. Picnic tables were ordered but not delivered in time, so assembly will be scheduled at a later date. “I always find it surprising that most people have no idea that this backcountry thing even exists.

He has flown many sorties into and near the Bob Marshall Wilderness with the express purpose of camping and fly fishing. As an environmental remediation engineer working on abandoned Montana mine cleanups, he was able to spend time in the air in Big Sky Country.</p> <p>Rob&nbsp;later returned home to Michigan, taking a job in the Upper Peninsula – fondly called the Yoop – where his family has deep Finnish roots. He engaged in remediation work in the Copper Country of the UP as an engineer responsible for a $15 million Superfund project to stabilize mine tailings from a historic ore stamp mill operation. He then took on responsibility for assorted stream reconstruction projects in the Copper Country.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rob-Aho-1-1-1024x956.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-15806" width="300" height="278"/></figure></div> <p>Flying opportunity was limited and kids began to arrive, so he embarked on constructing his own taildragger with handling characteristics similar to the Citabria. &nbsp;</p> <p>“In 2011, I took flight in my Rans S-7S Courier, and it wasn’t long before I outfitted the plane with Bushwheels, skis and other Alaska mods,” he says. It was during this time that he became an RAF supporter. Ever since, he has flown each of his three kids into North Fox Island and Two-Hearted airfields, in addition to countless local frozen lakes and beaches.&nbsp;</p> <p>His plane is based on a grass airstrip and hangar that he designed and built near his residence. He joins Michigan Liaison General Grant and Ambassadors John Riordan and Brad Frederick, former Liaison. “As an RAF Michigan Liaison, I hope to further improve and expand flight access into the Yoop backcountry,” he says.</p> <p>Contact&nbsp;Rob&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:raho@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raho@theraf.org</a><br>906-370-2135</p> <p><em>Submitted on December 22, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

So, when he learned that there was a volunteer opportunity that he and his fellow pilots were uniquely suited to help with, he jumped at the opportunity. At a regional level review of backcountry Forest Service airstrips, Bill told Forest Service employees that the Sand Point branch of the Daher Company—a French aviation conglomerate&#8211;“had offered us 50 hours of Kodiak time to help transport materials” and asked if he could be of assistance and after some discussion the Moose Creek project was identified as a good fit.</p> <p>Once the project was identified, McGlynn began to mobilize. Utilizing a cost-sharing agreement with the Forest Service, he purchased posts and rails from a local Montana company and had them transported to the Missoula airport. Minuteman Aviation donated its maintenance ramp at the airport for a week so they could perform preparatory work. Because Moose Creek is in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, where only hand tools can be used, his team needed to drill and perform other powered mechanical work before the airlift began.&nbsp; With the help of six eager volunteers, they were ready to start hauling the new fence to Moose Creek only a day later.</p> <p>Unfortunately, their team hit another snag: the Kodiak was too small a plane for the 10 and 1/2 foot fence rails. Luckily, the USFS Region 1 aviation team led by Shane Bak was able to step in and help with the Shorts Sherpa and load crew that accommodated their materials.&nbsp; The longer rails were all transported, and the work began on time October 13, 2023.&nbsp; The first of 20 volunteers, which included people from Indiana, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and the Pacific Northwest, all flew to Moose Creek to start removing the old fence and assembling new jack-leg fence.</p> <p>“It wasn’t hard at all for me to recruit people to come help out here when they found out this place needs work and they want to give back,” McGlynn explained. In fact, he intentionally limited recruitment: “We didn’t go broadly asking for people to sign up because we thought we’d get too many volunteers.”&nbsp; The process of putting up the fence “felt like an orchestra with everyone doing what they felt most comfortable doing and were best at.” “The fence went up so fast that we had to slow down because materials weren’t coming fast enough to keep up with us.”</p> <p>In just four and a half days, McGlynn’s team installed 1260 feet of replacement fence and got all the old, deteriorated fence out and organized in piles to be burnt later. Only 1000 feet of replacement fence remains to be installed. The Historic Moose Creek Ranger Station is the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness hub supporting youth development in resource stewardship, back country recreation, outfitter and guide operations, scientific research, wildland fire management and wilderness values. &nbsp;“RAF’s commitment to Moose Creek Ranger Station goes well beyond solely benefitting recreational aviation. Their work supports the wide variety of work we do, and we are fortunate to have them as partners,” said Moose Creek District Ranger Ron Tipton.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15373" width="622" height="467" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tearing down old fencing and putting up the new and improved fencing</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Fence-Project.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15562" width="634" height="476" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Fence-Project.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Fence-Project-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Fence-Project-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fencing supplies arrive at the Missoula Airport</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Group-Shot-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15563" width="639" height="359" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Group-Shot-edited.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Group-Shot-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moose-Creek-Group-Shot-edited-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Volunteers pose for a group photo after their achievement of removing and replacing 1260 feet of fence!</figcaption></figure></div> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pre-drilling-fence-rails.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15564" width="648" height="556" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pre-drilling-fence-rails.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pre-drilling-fence-rails-300x258.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pre-drilling-fence-rails-768x660.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pre-drilling posts and rails at Minuteman Aviation in Missoula</figcaption></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted November 30, 2023</em></p> ]]>

Taken by Jo Schumacher.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>To say Margie Prill is husband (and RAF co-founder) Dan’s “backup” is true, but it only tells part of the story. “We hosted a burger barbecue in our hangar in Sand Coulee way back in about 2002. More than a dozen folks came, and the topic was backcountry recreational flying, and building interest in preserving airstrips,” Margie says. Does that sound like the next step after those six guys sat around the campfire and decided to save airstrips? It was an essential step for an organization that now includes over 11,000 people – an organization that’s logged innumerable success stories from coast-to-coast.</p> <p>Margie&#8217;s hardly taken off her apron since. The RAF gathered momentum and throughout the years a lot of the gathering included meals cooked on wood stoves, or in kitchens across the country where Margie helped feed RAF volunteers on site for conferences, trade shows, and fly-ins. “The AOPA convention in Tampa is where we met Tim and Ann Clifford,” Margie says. Tim became an early RAF Florida Liaison; then Director.</p> <p>If not cooking, Margie has staffed the RAF booth at trade shows and conferences. Anyone who’s enjoyed a Ryan Fly-in would have seen Margie and Dan serving as “ground crew”, hauling supplies, maintaining facilities, and if time permitted, relaxing at the end of the day, maybe with their sons, daughters-in law, and grandkids. Early RAF photos featured the darling girls, just a little taller each year. A retired Special Education and Elementary teacher, Margie was the perfect one tasked with keeping all the kids who came to Ryan safe among the flying activity. She entertained them with creative games, treasure hunts, and projects. Even today, Ryan Field visitors are greeted with painted rocks with welcoming messages.</p> <p>One of her favorite activities during the Ryan Fly-in was organizing the wood stove cook off. “My granddaughters entered, so I had to find judges,” she says. The event was popular with everyone when the results of all the baking were turned out to cool, and enjoyed. “It was a rainy weekend, so gathering in the pilot shelter around the wood stove was cozy and wonderful,” she recalls.</p> <p>Another volunteer job is writing thank you notes since becoming an RAF “VP’s of Appreciation in 2016.</p> <p>For 17 years, Margie helped Dan host at the rustic cabin they co-owned with Dan’s brothers on Prill Lake in Saskatchewan, only accessible by floatplane. They supplied the place for guests at Ft. McMurray, Alberta, then either chartered a floatplane in, or Dan arrived in his Cub on floats. “He only had room for supplies OR me,” Margie says. So she would make the 12-hour drive to Ft. McMurray from their Sand Coulee home near Great Falls, Montana, then get a floatplane ride to the cabin. Guests enjoyed their days fishing for walleye, lake trout, and northern pike on the pristine lake, topped off with Prill’s fish fry, with corn on the cob, and Margie’s blueberry pie.</p> <p>Few know that before all this, Margie had a short career as a carnival worker. Her father, always dreaming of creative ways to earn a living, bought a Ferris Wheel and a merry-go-round from a carnival with a partner and they put their eight kids to work operating it, even under the lights on summer nights. The kids handled the money and loaded and unloaded riders. “I learned a lot about working, and had a lot of fun,” Margie says.</p> <p>Now the Prills enjoy wintering in Arizona where Margie serves her Westpark Resort residential co-op as treasurer, and knits beautiful baby afghans to give friends who are welcoming newborns into their lives. She and Dan enjoy tooling around Arizona on their side-by-side and have met many new friends along the trail. For 40 years she has taught bible study and continues; and as of 2022, has been married to Dan for 50 years. They still are very active in aviation, as Dan and his pilot-son Ted recently completed an RV-7 in Dan’s shop at home in Sand Coulee.</p> <p>Prill’s son Tom, also a pilot, and his wife Krista live in Billings, Montana, and those two “little” girls that folks watched grow up during visits at Ryan Field? One is in college and one is a high school sophomore as of this writing. Tom’s twin Ted and his wife also live in Billings. Son Danny and his daughter live in Sand Coulee where he drills water wells for his living. Daughter Shelly lives in San Diego. After fulfilling active duty at sea, she’s in the Navy Reserves refurbishing ships.</p> <p>“I’ve met so many wonderful people and have had such a good time,” Margie says, of her varied career and pastimes. So you may see her and Dan on the trails in Arizona, camping at a backcountry airstrip, or in their fifth-wheel anyplace, USA. Tip your hat to one – no two – very good friends of the RAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Because of the Wilderness designation, the Forest Service transports equipment and supplies for the ranger station and lookouts primarily by mule teams. Naturally, livestock needs fencing, and the original fences were in need of replacement.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robert-Miller-and-JC-Carroll.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15372" width="323" height="228" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robert-Miller-and-JC-Carroll.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robert-Miller-and-JC-Carroll-300x212.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robert-Miller-and-JC-Carroll-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></figure></div> <p>RAF Supporter Ed Kronfuss took on the logistics challenge and procured the posts and rails in Lincoln, Montana. Since no power tools are permitted in the Wilderness, Kronfuss had the posts and rails trucked to the Missoula airport where volunteers pre-drilled them for easier assembly.&nbsp;Daher-Kodiak provided the Kodiak 100 to haul the prepared posts to Moose Creek; and the USFS Shorts Sherpa carried the fence rails.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15373" width="348" height="261" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></figure></div> <p>Working under USFS direction, as many as 21 RAF volunteers arrived at the airstrip and removed and replaced 1,260 feet of fence. Early October can be wintery at this 2,450 elevation, but the crews enjoyed shirt-sleeve temperatures, and all tent camped for the four days it took to pull down the old fence and erect the almost quarter mile of new. &nbsp;“It was like the Egyptians showed up with all the pyramid builders. I’ve been in construction for 35 years and have never seen so much progress in such a short time,” Kronfuss said.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15374" width="299" height="228" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project2.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project2-300x229.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Moose-Creek-fence-project2-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></figure></div> <p>“Everyone in the work party participated where they saw fit, and the work flowed with the many hands. There was a lot of sweat and digging in by all,” Jensen said. Non-pilot volunteer Jim Maurus described it as, “An amazing opportunity where a self-guided team all worked well to accomplish a lot, ‘fueled’ by cooks Fred and Alex.”</p> <p>RAF President Bill McGlynn explains that in 1980 recreation was added to the list of functions of Moose Creek. “Pilots found a treasure in the backcountry to take family and friends camping, hiking, and fishing. About 500 GA airplanes make Moose Creek a camping destination every year,” he says. &nbsp;</p> <p>“What a great group of resources on both sides of this project – civilian aviators and Forest Service working together,” Jensen added.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Priscu-and-Bill-McGlynn.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-15375" width="383" height="287" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Priscu-and-Bill-McGlynn.jpeg 800w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Priscu-and-Bill-McGlynn-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Priscu-and-Bill-McGlynn-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></figure></div> <p>&#8220;This was an amazing collaboration of our volunteers and the Forest Service,” said McGlynn. “Volunteers just rolled up their sleeves and started working. Everyone found some new muscles and also found some new friends.&nbsp; People came from all over the Pacific Northwest, Montana, Idaho and as far as California to participate and we couldn&#8217;t have done this without them,” McGlynn said.</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 27, 2023 <br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Those influences often can come from people we are close to, especially when a) we look carefully; and b) their life experiences have shaped them in significant ways.</p> <p>Let me briefly share with you how three particular folks have been an important part of my life and how the way they lived their lives and their accomplishments have shaped and inspired my thinking about The RAF and our purpose.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:31% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="805" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3975-805x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15340 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>I am very fortunate to come from a family, generations, of aviators. This is a photo of my grandad, Oliver Walton Simmons, taken in front of his Stearman trainer when he was only 22 years old. While later in life he was far too humble to have considered himself part of “the Greatest Generation”, that is exactly what he was for aviation and more. He flew the B-26 closer to the end of WWII and later privately for business in Georgia. He passed his love of aviation on to all three of his sons: Bill – a naval aviator, Bob – an aerospace engineer; and John (my dad) – a flight medic in the Army.

Jeff has used these resources and the platform of ORNL to help address some of the most complex national and global challenges that society faces.

Here we are together with friends at Trigger Gap a few years back. A former Commanding Officer of the Thunderbirds and most recently the recognized voice for general aviation flight safety, I was fortunate to know Richard personally, fly the backcountry with him, and call him a mentor.</p> </div></div> <p>Through his thoughtful guidance and counsel, five years ago he helped me find the courage, humility, and voice to tell my own accident story….which was then and still is the best therapy I have ever received. I am eternally grateful to Richard for that.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it’s his own words that paint the picture of someone who so well understood his opportunity to make an impact in aviation. ‘<em>Flying has brought so much to my life and in many ways has been my life. The feeling of gratitude to the many people who’ve boosted me here comes back frequently… in ways that it seems unfair that I was exposed to aviation and given opportunities few have…and I feel a growing urge to give back, cast a wider net and expose more people to this splendid experience that can change the trajectory of a life.</em>’ I know I speak for all of us when I say that the gift of Richard’s contributions to aviation has been ours, that it is actually all of us that have unfairly but so gratefully had him in our lives and that together we shared the sky and a passion for flight.</p> <p>So what do Oliver, Jeff, and Richard all have in common in the way that they each live or have lived their lives, their commitment to others, and the lasting legacy and impact of their efforts? Summed up simply, each has ‘left flying and aviation better than they found it’ …profoundly so.</p> <p>And so it is for each of us and our talents, gifts, effort and engagement with The RAF, our commitment to the mission, and our motivation to sustain the culture – culture that I believe can be summed by that same simple phrase that the lives of these three folks represent. I am confident you each know similar folks that challenge, inspire, and motivate &#8211; think about them often and the example of their lives when you appreciate the opportunity, privilege, and obligation we have to ‘leave things better than we found them’ through The RAF.</p> <p>Fly safely,<br>-Todd</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 35%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Todd is the President of Customer Experience at Cirrus Aircraft, where he has worked for 15 years.

He drove another nine-hour round trip to be on site for the structure’s delivery and installation. In spite of some rain that created challenges for the semi-truck, the entire project went well. “They were very precise when preparing the site, using laser leveling equipment,” Keller observed. “I find it strangely rewarding to feel a sense of accomplishment over a vault toilet. It&#8217;s not an airstrip, but it will make the airstrip more inviting to visitors,” he added.</p> <p>Prior to landing at Sacaton, permission is required by calling USFS Gila Dispatch center at 800-538-1644.

AOPA&#8217;s VP of Airports and State Advocacy Mike Ginter introduced each of the seven. These persons bird-dog issues critical to General Aviation like preserving airports facing closure, preventing airspace encroachments and unreasonable ramp and user fees. Other timely initiatives are Avgas supply and hangar availability. They are registered lobbyists, and are GA’s advocates in state legislatures and at airports in all 50 states.</p> <p>RAF Liaisons from each region tuned in for advocacy updates from their AOPA counterparts, who encouraged RAF Liaisons to bring forward issues of concern in their states. One current mutual effort is preserving Custer State Park airport, threatened with closure due to runway maintenance cost. Both the RAF and AOPA have issued Calls to Action encouraging pilots to oppose the plan to close the facility. More than one AOPA Regional Manager gave examples of success in preserving an airport, thanks to pilot-citizen comment and participation. The most recent example of a big win was Portage, Wisconsin, where 70 pilots and community members attended a city council meeting to oppose closure of this airport (C47). City Council reversed their decision and has voted to keep Portage Municipal airport open and seek state and local funding.</p> <p>Alaska’s Tom George updated the group on efforts to increase the number of live webcams – now occurring in the lower 48 – and the successful charting of useful information at mountain passes, beginning in Alaska. See AOPA’s website on “mountain pass charting”.</p> <p>Ginter explained that the Congressional FAA Reauthorization bill has passed the House; AOPA will notify members when and how to contact US senators to vote “yes” when the Senate takes up their version of the Reauthorization Bill. Ginter said, “We value our strong working relationship with the RAF and all State Liaisons, and enjoy collaborating to save airports!”</p> <p>The services these persons provide are another benefit of AOPA membership. The RAF encourages all pilots to support the organization that for nearly 80 years has worked to protect our freedom to fly.

Not only does she get it, she loves to work with people to make a difference in aviation. “I’m a facilitator. I work behind-the-scenes, pressing for clear action plans and follow through.” &nbsp;</p> <p>Maybe her career in chemical manufacturing prepared her. But it’s obvious she has a passion for sharing her love of flying around her adopted state of New Mexico with its great year-round weather and landscapes. “We moved here for the flying,” she points out.</p> <p>Joyce and her husband Art are both pilots. “I married into flying,” she says. Art got his license out of high school; his father and two uncles were pilots. “Our first airplane was a Mooney,” Joyce said, “It was like having a sports car that I couldn’t drive,” which motivated her to get her license. “That was thirty years ago,” she adds. Now Art flies their RV-7A and both fly Joyce’s Hawk XP which is great to explore the NM backcountry.</p> <p>New Mexico has seen a lot of success preserving and re-opening airstrips, and Joyce is quick to credit a long line of RAF predecessors, beginning with RAF Director Emeritus Rol Murrow, and former New Mexico Liaison (now Ambassador) Larry Filener. “With their vision and a strong core group of volunteers including current NM Liaison Ron Keller, we’ve gotten a lot accomplished,” Joyce says, adding, “Ron Keller is a workhorse! He’s great to work with, brings valuable experience and gets the job done!”</p> <p>In 2010, Joyce became president of a struggling New Mexico Pilots Association. Catching wind of a group forming a backcountry group, she encouraged them to create a Backcountry Committee of NMPA. John McKenna made a visit and inspired them to carry out the RAF mission in her state. She was instrumental in organizing the New Mexico Airstrip Network in 2014 with Rol, Larry, Ron and then-State Aviation Director Steve Summers, inspired by Idaho’s network. By 2016, a historic MOU was signed at the USFS Regional Headquarters in Albuquerque formalizing “the collaborative partnership of federal and state agencies, aviation groups, landowners, and other stakeholders to preserve, promote, and enhance New Mexico’s growing inventory of recreational airfields.” &nbsp;</p> <p>The continuity provided by the MOU has assured support for airstrip rehabilitation and development, despite leadership succession in member organizations. Negrito Airstrip now has a vault toilet, fire ring, picnic tables, and a kiosk, all due to NMPA and RAF volunteers and partnership with the USFS. BLM’s Cuba Landing Strip, NM2 is back on the charts with plans for future development.</p> <p>“We moved the base for the annual Gila Fly-In from Negrito to Reserve, T16 to more visibly demonstrate the aviation tourism potential and how valuable these remote airstrips are to rural communities,” Joyce says. Reserve provides easy access to seven USFS airstrips, two of which were restored and reopened since 2020 by RAF and NMPA volunteers – Rainy Mesa, NM54 and Sacaton, NM16. “We are no longer invisible,” she says. “Our fly-ins are an economic boost to area businesses.” State and local agencies recognize the opportunity and are supporting development including a Reserve airport terminal building project now underway. “There wasn’t even a Porta-Potty before,” Joyce says.</p> <p>There are several annual fly-ins to New Mexico backcountry airfields, hosted by NMPA with support from the RAF. “Through partners in the Airstrip Network, we’ve organized events at local community airports to coincide. For example, Ron hosts the annual Amigos del Cielo Fly-In, NM90. Nearby, the Lordsburg Airport (KLSB) was threatened with closure in 2019, so NMPA coordinated with the city and NM Aviation Division for a community fly-in. “Pilots come to refuel their planes and Lordsburg serves up a great lunch while the community sees the value of their airport,” she says. RAF Supporter Perry Null coordinates with Ramah, NM locals to host the annual Mystic Bluffs, NM56 Fly-In, “known for the biggest and best breakfast spread ever – another remote community that loves to mingle with aviators,” she adds.</p> <p>The Woods’ desire to share aviation includes active involvement in EAA, providing Young Eagle flights and supporting adult pilot students and youth scholarship recipients.<br><br>We hope you catch Woods’ irresistible enthusiasm for flying in New Mexico. Bring your camping gear, your appetite, and prepare to enjoy clear skies, great hospitality, and plenty of choice destinations.</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 9, 2023<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

There was also a large oak tree that had fallen into the lake a few weeks earlier.&nbsp;A team jumped into action to get the oak cut up and removed from the lake.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0040_1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15266" width="518" height="389" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0040_1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0040_1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0040_1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></figure></div> <p>The meals at this event could not have been better.&nbsp;Friday evening featured a good old Wisconsin fish fry, and Saturday&#8217;s potluck lunch for 250 folks included some outstanding grilled pork chops. A special addition to the meal this year was fresh baked pecan pies courtesy of RAF supporter Rachel Thompson.&nbsp;Remarkably, Rachel brought the ingredients all the way from Oklahoma and then made up the pies in her tent.&nbsp;Judy lent the use of her oven for the baking.&nbsp;When asked if she has ever attended a fly-in without baking a pie, Rachel simply replied, &#8220;what would be the point?&#8221;</p> <p>Bob and Judy commented that the 29 airplanes in attendance were very near a record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0060-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15267" width="618" height="464"/></figure></div> <p>A huge thank you to Bob and Judy for hosting this amazing event, to all the EAA631 family members for their support, and to all the RAF supporters that helped to make it happen.</p> <p>There are already rumblings that there will be another Lakewood Lodge picnic in the Fall of 2024.</p> <p>You are invited to enjoy the video below, put together by Voortex Productions, which highlights Bob and Judy’s efforts in making Lakewood Lodge such a special place to visit.

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Andy Turner, a pilot, aquatic ecologist</em>, <em>and longtime friend of the RAF.</em></p> <p><strong>Growing Up With The RAF</strong>:</p> <p>I recently rousted Joshua and Caleb, my two teenage sons, out of bed early on a rainy Sunday morning. The task at hand was cutting and stacking firewood at the campground we are developing at our local airport. Getting teenage boys out of bed on a Sunday morning to go work in the rain might seem nearly impossible, but Josh and Caleb got up without complaint, found breakfast, and spent a few satisfying hours wielding chainsaws and stacking wood. I think my success in getting them rolling on this job, and our successes in navigating the complexities of raising teenagers, might be traced in part back to a camp some 14 years earlier in the Bob Marshall Wilderness.</p> <p>It was the summer of 2009. My wife, Sharon, and I loaded our 15-month-old twins into the back seat of the family hauler, a Cessna 172, and flew to northern Montana from our home in Pennsylvania. Looking back, flying two children across the country in the back seat of a 172 was a bit crazy, but dealing with twins will make a person resort to extreme measures. We set up camp at Schaffer Meadows and felt a bit sorry for our fellow campers who had to put up with the antics of two toddlers. Among the campers were most of the RAF Directors, then a fledgling organization working to sharpen its focus. John McKenna and crew were discussing strategic directions over a campfire but graciously invited us, toddlers and all, to join them. We shared meals and stayed up late sharing stories. I have fond memories of Tim Clifford bouncing Josh on his knee, with Josh laughing in the way only a 15-month-old child can. We enjoyed a wonderful week hiking the mountains and resolved to fly west each summer for a week or two of hiking, fishing, and catching up with friends.</p> <p>Fast forward 14 years to June 2023. Josh, Caleb and I are camped at Meadow Creek, part way through our annual adventure of long hikes through the Bob Marshall Wilderness. The first hike, a three-day backpack trip towards Silvertip Mountain, ended earlier than we had planned, turned back by deep snow on the ridge lines. I gave my sons a list of options as to how we could spend the coming weekend. The conversation ended when they heard that the annual Ryan Field work party was one of the options, as they both insisted on helping out. We made the short hop over to Ryan where they woke up early on Saturday morning and spent the day happily cutting firewood, clearing brush, painting, and mowing grass. Most of all, we enjoyed sharing a dinner table and campfire with old friends and meeting new friends. We traded stories of flying, mountain adventures, and reflected on memories. On the surface of it, you might think that we are building an airport, but look a little closer, and you will see that we are building friendships and community. Ryan Field benefited from our labors, but we all emerged from the experience grateful for the opportunity to be a part of something larger than ourselves.</p> <p>There is a straight line connecting our early experiences at Schaffer with the growth of two hard working young men, eager for mountain adventures and eager to volunteer for community service, and the line runs right through the RAF. Raising teenagers in 2023 isn’t a simple task and I often turn to trusted friends for help. I employ a simple recipe: find a challenging activity, assign my sons a task on that activity working side by side with folks I admire and respect, and let what happens, happen. In our family the activity often involves hunting or fishing, and we have a close knit “outdoors family” of friends that have mentored Joshua and Caleb from a young age under the guise of flyfishing or bird hunting. Aviation is a huge part of our lives too and we are fortunate that our RAF family has provided valuable mentorship. The RAF is an important part of our family because it embodies traits we teach our children: politeness, persistence patience, and humility. Further, the RAF seems to attract people who are uniformly hard working, kind, generous, and good humored. Josh and Caleb have spent many hours over the years working on projects side by side with our RAF family, quietly absorbing the examples of their character, and I can see how those experiences have helped shape them into the people they are. Thus, Josh and Caleb carry a bit of the RAF influence with them in all they do and are. As a parent, I couldn’t be more grateful.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_2871-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15172" width="354" height="354"/></figure></div> <p><em>Andy has been a pilot for nearly 40 years and flies a RV-10 that he built to carry his family on long cross-country trips. Using their airplane to access the backcountry, Andy and his sons have climbed a number of high peaks in wilderness areas including the Bob Marshall of Montana, the Wind River Range of Wyoming, and the mountains of Colorado.

Recognizing the untapped recreational potential of the area, Turner approached Airport Manager Donald Kimball, and received enthusiastic support for a project and improvements.</p> <p>Turner and Kimball initiated an effort to develop a campground just outside the airport fence, adjacent to a two-acre pond. The project really serves to improve two issues — the site is an abandoned coal mine that was never property restored. The ground was uneven and overgrown with invasive shrubs and small trees. With the support of the airport board, Kimball and his assistant used heavy equipment to grade and level the ground, and clear trees and shrubs. They purchased and spread topsoil and applied grass seed. “This was a considerable investment of labor, equipment, and materials,” Turner said. “The results of the site work are very encouraging. We now have a nice level site with large shade trees adjacent to a good fishing pond.”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Clarion-1024x614.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15193" width="622" height="373"/></figure></div> <p>KAXQ is popular among recreationists. It’s nearly surrounded by State Gameland 63 – a 3,700-acre tract of rugged country with no motorized vehicle access, offering excellent opportunities for hunting, fishing, hiking, wildlife viewing, and bird watching. The 4,800-mile North Country Trail that runs from North Dakota to Vermont is immediately adjacent to the airport. It’s one of North America’s longest hiking trails. “Because of its prominence in the hiking community, the trail attracts a large number of visitors from outside the region,” Turner pointed out. “Tables and fire rings will make this an attractive spot for tent camping and should begin to attract visitors, who&nbsp;hopefully will enjoy the positive experience and spread the word of the recreational opportunities,” he added. He envisions further phased improvements, and for Clarion County to appear in the Airfield Guide.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Written by Carmine Mowbray.</em><br><em>Submitted on September 28, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This was partially matched with in-kind donations and volunteer labor. “Thanks to terrific weather and help from visiting pilots David Butler and Chris Erkmann, everything was accomplished,” RAF Illinois Ambassador Dave Warner reported. “It&#8217;s a big improvement already, but another rolling should really make a difference,” he added. </p> <p>In addition, trees and brush were cleared from along the runway and the approach to Runway 03. “There&#8217;s always more to be done, but the field is much more inviting,” he said, and pointed out that the&nbsp;resulting supply of firewood at the campsite is probably&nbsp;sufficient for a couple of years. The owners acquired a new mower to do a better job of mowing the runway, and are generous in allowing public access.</p> <p>Joining Warner and his wife Ann to accomplish the work were&nbsp;Henderson&nbsp;airfield owners John (Herbie) and Cindy&nbsp;Henderson, Cliff Hisey, Dave Butler, and Chris Erkmann. “A full moon, evening meals together, swimming from the pontoon raft, and serenades from owls and coyotes added to the experience,”&nbsp;Warner said. The airfield is 2,410 feet long, and Hendersons kindly allow camping, hiking and access to a 4-wheeler. Water and toilet are available in the shop building. Visitors may fish and swim, and use the canoe, kayak or&nbsp;John boat&nbsp;available to enjoy the on-site lake.</p> <p>You are invited to take advantage of this&nbsp;quiet spot in one of the dark sky areas of Illinois, by joining the&nbsp;Astronomical Association of Southern Illinois&nbsp;for its stargazing party at&nbsp;Henderson&nbsp;Field on October 21. “Planning is underway for a fly-in to experience some of the surprises hiding in Southern Illinois, as well the marvels of deep space,” Warner added. Camping is welcomed, and as an alternative, there are Air B&amp;Bs nearby. If interested in details regarding the stargazing weekend, contact Warner at <a href="mailto:dwarner@theraf.org">dwarner@theraf.org</a>.</p> <p>Find more about&nbsp;Henderson&nbsp;Field and the required safety briefing in the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;AoJVcUvGMWiCKTfFbmkw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted September 15, 2023<br>Written by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Thank you for your efforts to comment,” she added.<br><br>Although the results are favorable, the effort to ensure the future of aviation access isn’t over.</p> <p>The BLM has opened a 90-day public comment period on the four alternatives and the next step is a series of virtual meetings and in-person meetings that began September 6. The virtual/public meetings are listed here: <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2020343/510">https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2020343/510</a></p> <p>The RAF encourages you to read the Draft EIS, and participate in the public meetings. The BLM is now seeking new information not included before to help them refine their analysis. Your comment should state why something in the Draft EIS should be different, and back up your reason, with particular attention to how backcountry aviation would be addressed in Alternative C – the BLM’s preferred Alternative. Make your voice heard for why the existing, but previously unrecognized airstrips in the GSENM should remain open for unrestricted recreational aviation use. Your comments help ensure historic access to these seven airstrips. Here are talking points:</p> <p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation has developed MOUs with the BLM to provide cooperative maintenance of backcountry airstrips.</p> <p>Airstrips are trailheads: aviators are non-motorized recreationists, participating in hiking, camping and other low-impact activities.</p> <p>Aircraft, which are a type of Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV), cause less soil and vegetation disturbance than all other types of OHVs which have driven tires.</p> <p>Backcountry airstrips do not require a network of roads and trails to access. A remote airstrip closed to other OHVs could continue to be accessible for recreational aviation use without adverse environmental impact.</p> <p>Typical backcountry airstrips require less than 2 acres. No additional facilities or infrastructure is needed other than a safe area to take off and land. Backcountry airstrips in the GSENM need only occasional maintenance. Utah Back Country Pilots and the RAF provide maintenance volunteers using hand tools, thereby minimizing environmental disturbance.</p> <p>The 7 previously undesignated airstrips in the GSENM have only incidental use. For clarity, they are: Bowington, Cedar Wash, Collet Top, Colt Mesa, Grand Bench, Pilot Knoll, and Squaw Bench. When not in use, an airstrip blends seamlessly into the environmental landscape.</p> <p>Most Utah backcountry airstrips have been in existence since the 1950s, predating the 1964 Wilderness Act. Access and use of these airstrips should be retained.<br><br>The 90-day public comment period closes Nov. 9, 2023. Your public comments count. Thank you for helping preserve these unique and priceless backcountry aviation assets. As always, fly with respect for other backcountry users.</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 15, 2023<br>Written by Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Volunteers&#8217; efforts were appreciated and Richard and Kathy Robinson of Rainbow Lodge were acknowledged for their kind hospitality. “If not for them, this could not have happened. We cannot thank everyone enough for all that was accomplished by this huge volunteer effort,” former RAF Liaison Brad Frederick said.</p> <p>Last October, thanks to an RAF grant and RAF supporter Jeff Littmann’s substantial matching donation, volunteers coordinated by Frederick and current Liaison General Grant worked to re-open the overgrown airfield. In spite of cold weather, the crew made the three and-a-half hour drive to haul in a large bucket loader, road grader, skid loader, roller/compactor, and straw chopper to the site. Mike Hintz brought up his fifth wheel camper for the volunteers to use as jobsite headquarters.&nbsp;They re-graded uneven areas, brought in topsoil and compacted and seeded it. The State then inspected and re-opened the field. After allowing the new grass seed to take root, Two Hearted Airstrip is now in suitable condition for use.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230827_095803-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15133" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230827_095803-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230827_095803-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230827_095803-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <p>Grant reports 36 folks in 21 aircraft and groups in vehicles arrived at the August 26 celebration. “Nearly a third of those attending were there for the first time,” Grant observed. They enjoyed a campfire ceremony, hiked trails, picked Michigan’s famous wild blueberries, and hunted for agates during the day, and Yooperlites in the dark. Residents of the UP are fondly called “Yoopers” and this local stone – rich with fluorescent sodalite – was so dubbed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The group enjoyed lamb kabobs, steak, kielbasa, and hot dogs. A small group flew to the Grand Marais sand dunes and back.&nbsp;“Those who stayed up late were treated to bright stars, and a clear view of the Milky Way and the Northern Lights,” Grant added.&nbsp;</p> <p>Would a person need any more reasons to visit?

But CAP activities were all about marching, not flying, so he jumped at the chance when a local pilot offered a ride. He loaded three kids in a Cessna 172 and after full stop landings, gave each one a chance to fly in the left seat.</p> <p>“No one believed me when I told them I’d flown an airplane,” Bill says. He was 13 years old.</p> <p>Bill finished high school, worked for the railroad to pay for his MBA at the University of Montana, married, and flew whenever someone offered. “Not sure everyone I flew with even had a license,” he admits. He trained in a Champ with a 200-something pound instructor, never realizing how over gross they were. On his first solo, without the “sandbag ballast” that had kept the taildragger lined up and solidly on the ground, the plane floated down the runway then ran off the side. Bill returned the airplane to the runway bewildered, but undamaged.</p> <p>Hewlett-Packard hired him and he moved to Boise. This began his career representing HP all over the world, “flying three million miles in the back of United Airlines aircraft. While everyone else was watching movies, I listened to ATC on Channel 9,” he says, and got very comfortable with ATC lingo.</p> <p>Career and family filled the next decades, but Bill got his private pilot rating. ”It took me until age 45, but I never lost the desire.” For $800, he bought into the aero club in Nampa, near Boise. He had access to several aircraft types, including 182s that were allowed in the backcountry, so he flew solo into Smiley Creek and Garden Valley. His instructor took him in a Citabria to Big Creek and Warm Springs, and Bill realized he’d benefit from canyon and mountain flying instruction. Lori MacNichol arranged lessons with Idaho Aviation Hall of Famer Jim Larkin whose 25,000 hours included DC-3s and Ford Tri-Motors for Johnson Flying Service, mail contracts and fire bombing, all in the mountain West. “I’ll teach ya,” he said to Bill, and he did.</p> <p>“How about I take you to my favorite place?” Larkin asked one day. He had Bill head into Moose Creek, Idaho. They approached from the west, and as the canyon became narrower and narrower, Larkin said, “Lower … lower … lower …” then the field came into sight.</p> <p>“That smell of pine was just overwhelming to me, maybe because I hadn’t been breathing!” Bill says. The history, beauty, and its location so far in the backcountry really impressed Bill. He took his son and friends there, creating many favorite memories.</p> <p>“When I tried to go online and make a donation to this new RAF organization, PayPal was the only option,” Bill says. Not being registered with the app, he gave up and went on to other things. Some time later he flew into Moose Creek again, and was met by airport volunteer Pinky Strong – the RAF’s first VP of Appreciation.&nbsp;</p> <p>“You’re in the Raf?” she asked.</p> <p>Bill corrected her. “No, I’m not in a raft, I flew in!”</p> <p>That was Bill’s personal introduction, and after Pinky described the RAF mission, he went home and mailed in his check.</p> <p>He noticed the name “John McKenna” on RAF material and he wasn&#8217;t sure this could be the same John McKenna he&#8217;d known in Butte. He realized that they’d attended Butte Central High School together. “I was the one who drafted John into the Key Club!” John flew to Boise for a happy reunion, and he asked Bill, “You’re retired. Can you help us out?”</p> <p>Bill was invited to the Board. “I love the RAF culture, it’s the most attractive to me. It’s been said, ‘You’re never a stranger when you see an orange shirt or hat,’ and I respect and love that.” He made clear that he meant to make sure the board did a good job of keeping that culture. He also brought his executive and team leadership experience to the board, and helped facilitate an early strategic planning session.</p> <p>With the leisure retirement brings, Bill continued flying into Moose Creek. He’d deliver ice cream to the Forest Service staff, and haul out garbage, then ten years ago, became a volunteer for the USFS, making the month-long commitment as caretaker, opening up the facilities for the season. He flies his wife Julie in for part of the duration and she works alongside Bill cleaning after winter’s accumulation. “At 102 years old, the place needs a lot of care and feeding,” he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Flying the backcountry is the essence and attraction for me. It made such a difference in my life, and drives my ambition to extend these beautiful places for others through RAF initiatives,” he says.</p> <p>As just one example, at his beloved Moose Creek, the RAF used Forest Service cost sharing funds to level the old runway. Being in the Wilderness, no mechanical equipment is allowed, and Montana Conservation Corps youth and volunteers moved 54 wheelbarrow loads of dirt. Daher-Kodiak provided their Kodiak 900 to haul materials. Bill looks forward to the next project, again using a combination of funding from the Forest Service and a Resource Advisory Council grant to remove and replace over a quarter mile of jackleg fence to keep trail stock off the runway.</p> <p>“Some think you should keep these places secret. That’s not the RAF attitude,” Bill says, who now serves as the RAF’s Board President. “That’s the philosophy I admire about the RAF. At the same time, with more visitors, there’s more wear and tear. We want to do what’s required to take care of these places, and RAF leadership and ALL its supporters are willing to do that.”</p> <p>Bill doesn’t need ATC lingo to get in and out of the backcountry fields he loves, but these places speak to him in a very special language. And he is devoted to preserving them to share with others.</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 14, 2023.<br>By Carmine Mowbray</em><br></p> ]]>

Friendship forms the backbone of any relationship, be it personal, professional, or organizational. Space does not allow for me to name all the people who have become the best of friends, thanks to the RAF. For sure those first few of us who started the RAF bonded out of both necessity and desire. We had a common goal, and the trust we shared overcame the hurdles we faced starting the RAF. But even more than the relationships that began and thrived here, it became abundantly clear that friendships would be the secret sauce that created the flavor of the RAF.</p> <p>Friends do far more for one another than can be accounted for. I had a successful business career that was built on delivering a product for a fair price with good follow up and service added in. Those ingredients were the basis for the RAF, but so much more has happened in the 20 years since we began. If the RAF had merely utilized the typical exchange of goods and services for time put in vs benefit received, we simply would not be here today. Sure, we would have accomplished some things, but nowhere near the success that we have enjoyed together. Because at our heart, the RAF is just friends helping one another.</p> <p>Without these friendships, would we be enthusiastic about a fellow supporter’s advancement to a better position? The acquisition of a new airplane? The sale of a business allowing free time to pursue RAF goals? For sure we would not sit by the phone awaiting news of a medical test result of one of our own. Or joyfully suggest that a new baby be named after one of us!</p> <p>I have been so fortunate to meet so many along this journey. I can think of nothing more valuable that has been built than these enduring relationships. You have enriched the world of aviation, your friends, and, I can only hope, your own lives along the way. That, my friends, is THE RAF WAY.</p> <p>&#8211; John McKenna, RAF Chairman</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 13, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Jerry Wilke, a proud RAF supporter, longtime pilot, and former executive at Harley-Davidson</em>.</p> <p>It’s been a year of significant milestones … The RAF turned 20 … and some of you know my long history at Harley-Davidson, who turned 120 this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mission of the RAF is to “Preserve, improve, and create airstrips for recreational access.” True… but that’s like explaining H-D by saying, “they build motorcycles.” Both true statements, but both organizations have become so much more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Words often fall short. So at H-D we would simply say, “For those who&nbsp;<em>understand,</em>&nbsp;no explanation is necessary. For those who don’t, no explanation is possible.”&nbsp;</p> <p>And yes, I believe the RAF is in that category and has earned the comparison. Personal opinion: the RAF is clearly operating beyond its mission. The “people connection,” the relationships, campfire buddies, new lifelong friends, and kindred spirits. Both H-D and the RAF have developed way beyond what the founders had imagined. And in fact have become a core of what the organization is, and what the organization stands for!&nbsp;</p> <p>Pilots, especially back-country pilots – like motorcyclists, I think, get a bit more out of life by developing special skills that allow them to harness the laws of physics for a finite period of time; providing a special appreciation for this world and the thrill, adventure, and freedom that comes with it. A thrill that most want to repeat, share, and preserve for those that come after us. It’s not for everyone – that’s the point – and that only increases the allure and desire to experience, share, and preserve.&nbsp;</p> <p>As I get older, I find myself thinking more and more like the Ryans and the Gillettes. While few things are as thrilling as a good approach and gentle touchdown on a remote grass strip, it’s almost as gratifying these days to volunteer on an RAF weekend work detail, or send a year-end contribution to&nbsp;the RAF to insure that this feeling and these relationships continue into my son Ross’s generation of pilots and beyond.&nbsp;</p> <p>A philosopher once said, “Those who understand the meaning of life are those who plant trees, knowing they won’t be around to enjoy their shade!”&nbsp;</p> <p>Let’s thank God for the freedom of flight, and let’s thank the RAF for great friendships and backcountry places to experience it! Pass it on!</p> <p><em>Jerry has been a pilot for over 30 years and currently owns and flies a Cirrus for transportation… and for fun, with his son Ross, shares a Husky Amphib and a Husky on bush wheels. Jerry’s professional career spanned 35 years with Harley-Davidson in leadership positions in sales/marketing, brand management, and product planning. Responsibilities included the voice of the customer… and the look-sound-and-feel of H-D products and the brand. Post retirement involves consulting and public speaking in the aviation, marine, and motorsports industries including 10 years on the Advisory Board with Cirrus Aircraft, serving on the board of the AOPA Foundation, and many other non-profit and charitable activities.</em></p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG-5618_50-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-15012" width="595" height="447"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jerry and his son Ross with their Huskys in the background</figcaption></figure></div> <p class="has-text-align-left"><em>Featured image: Jerry during one of his favorite activities &#8211; providing a Young Eagles flight.</em><br><em>Submitted on August 30, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

If flying in, please purchase a nominal-cost pass for the privilege of recreating on this land.</p> <p>Ragmuff has camping and picnic areas, and an outhouse. The west branch of the Penobscot is a mile and-a-half hike from the field, with a chance to catch brook trout and landlocked salmon. Locals say that Fall is the premier time to visit – colors turn and it becomes bug-free, and partridge and fishing seasons overlap.

He and RAF Director Jeff Russell recognized this, and began imagining what was needed to attract visitors. “Hanley Field has very high recreational value due to its natural beauty, and its proximity to the National Lakeshore,” Grant said.</p> <p>He and Russell gathered support from the airport manager, local aviators, the Marquette EAA Chapter, and the Alger County Commission Chairman and drew up plans to add visitor amenities to an existing county building. A financial commitment from the RAF will help fund a restroom, shower, kitchenette, and space to accommodate storage and charging of electric bicycles so visitors can tour the town and access the Lakeshore. “Electric bikes will provide an efficient means of traveling the ‘last mile’,” Russell said. Visitors can explore on their own or take a commercial tour to enjoy sand dunes and deep forests, or spectacular views of sandstone cliffs and formations, caves, and waterfalls tumbling into the turquoise freshwater of Lake Superior.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:27% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="811" height="540" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC3530_50.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14950 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC3530_50.jpg 811w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC3530_50-300x200.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC3530_50-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>“This area offers fantastic recreational opportunities such as boating, swimming, kayaking, hiking, hunting, trapping, and fishing,” according to Russell.

The structure is designed with a privacy panel to serve as a place where folks can change clothes or hang a solar shower bag and enjoy an outdoor shower in relative privacy. An RAF grant made this possible along with funds raised during the annual Mt. Toberfest Fly-in and Campout at the airfield. “We have put your money to good use and created something everyone can appreciate,” Thomas said.</p> </div></div> <p>Thomas plans another work party to finish a few remaining tasks. The exterior will be weather sealed with stain, and skirt boards will be installed around the bottom. The plan is to lay a stone pad and decking around the shower area. A gravity feed water tank will be installed for a hand washing station.</p> <p>“For now we have a potty, and we could not be more excited!” he added.&nbsp;Plans for the structure will be archived for reference at other locations where a composting toilet is desired.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/2ff0125d-a358-4016-9104-2bbf8b09dd53/overview?searchQuery=waterbury">Airfield Guide</a> for more information on Waterbury, and its two turf runways.</p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em><br><em>Submitted August 31, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

While Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek have not sustained any notable damage from the flooding, at&nbsp;Chicken&nbsp;Strip&nbsp;in Saline Valley, 60% of the runway experienced a complete washout. The airstrip is closed and marked with X&#8217;s until further notice.&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, RAF California Liaisons Rick Lach and Katerina Barilov have organized work parties to maintain&nbsp;Chicken&nbsp;Strip, but given the extent of the damage to Saline Valley access roads, the timing for this year’s effort is yet to be determined.&nbsp;“We expect seasonal flooding and have no trouble getting volunteers to either drive or fly in to get the&nbsp;strip&nbsp;back to a condition the park will approve for reopening. But this year presents a bigger challenge, since all road access is closed,” Lach said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Inyo County, the State of California, and the Park Service are working through emergency contracts to re-open all primary roads that are the highest priority. Two hundred and three miles of NPS roads were completely destroyed, and 126 were significantly damaged. Officials hesitate to guess on the timing of re-opening secondary roads, such as the Saline Valley passes.</p> <p>Park rangers reported that the 2.2” downpour at Furnace Creek broke the record for the rainiest day in Park history.&nbsp;Chicken&nbsp;Strip&nbsp;lies at the base of a mountain range that recorded 5.46”, and Park Ranger Abby Wines reported, “The rocky slopes don’t absorb much water. The canyons function like a rain spout, channeling that runoff. However, in Death Valley that runoff is a fast-moving muddy soup carrying rocks.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Watch the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;KltXohCUOuUWHdPdetYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>&nbsp;and Park resources below for further notices.

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Craig Fuller, a dedicated RAF supporter and the former President of AOPA.</em></p> <p>RAF – Just Doesn’t Get Any Better: </p> <p>Only a few weeks had passed from the start of my tenure as president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) in 2009 when a call came in from a pleasant fellow in Montana.&nbsp;John McKenna proposed we have coffee in Washington, D.C. during his upcoming visit.&nbsp;After telling me just a little about the Recreational Aviation Foundation, run out of his kitchen, I suggested we have lunch.</p> <p>Within a few days, we were together at a fine dining restaurant sitting at the foot of the United States Capitol. The conversation was engaging and enlightening and would persuade any aviator to jump into a two-seat fabric covered backcountry aircraft and just have fun slipping the surly bonds of earth. I knew then, and time proved it to be more true than I could have imagined, time spent with John, Trish and the backcountry band of pilots making up the RAF would be among the best times I would have at AOPA.</p> <p>We stood to leave the table when I asked what John was planning for the afternoon.&nbsp;“Simple,” he replied, “I’m going to go see Max.&nbsp;I take care of his dogs and fly him around from time to time.”</p> <p>My reply, “If you mean the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, let’s sit back down.”</p> <p>Thus began an extraordinary friendship that spanned two different worlds from the most beautiful backcountry landing strips with the best people in aviation to the halls of Congress and government offices.&nbsp;When I think of the journey I enjoyed with the RAF, there are two things about which I am certain:&nbsp; 1) the aviation community is better and stronger today because the RAF does what it does; 2) I became a better and more passionate aviator.</p> <p>During my time at AOPA, I logged a few thousand hours of flying in all types of aircraft. The hours in the air I most clearly remember are ones flying my Husky around the country to the places these aircraft go, like Ryan Field.&nbsp;The planes, the places and the people just do not get any better.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:41% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="535" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-Husky-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14717 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-Husky-1.jpg 800w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-Husky-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-Husky-1-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>One photograph always comes out when people ask about the aircraft I flew. It is a shot taken by a colleague as I flew in my Husky next to Dave Hirschman in the AOPA Sweepstakes Husky south to the Florida Keys. Truth is, we were headed from Frederick, Maryland to Lakeland, Florida; but we were ahead of schedule, and so we linked up with Tim Clifford for a time and kept flying in beautiful Florida weather all the way to Key West.</p> </div></div> <p>Just the other day, one of my favorite photographs from the past popped onto my screen. It brought a smile as I recalled two of the finest people I met through the RAF: Ben and Butchie Ryan. I’d spotted a photo in Ben’s home as he gave me a tour of his memorabilia as a WWII fighter pilot.&nbsp;One picture caught my eye. Ben and Butchie embraced under his aircraft. Turned out, they enjoyed each other just as much as we stood together at the home Ben built for he and Butchie before he cleared the land for an <a href="https://theraf.org/ryan-field/">airstrip</a> on the edge of Glacier National Park.</p> <div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"> <div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryans-2-594x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14719" width="183" height="316" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryans-2-594x1024.png 594w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryans-2-174x300.png 174w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryans-2.png 644w" sizes="(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px" /></figure></div></div> <div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryans-801x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14718" width="248" height="316"/></figure></div></div> </div> <p>When it comes to the people, the places and the planes, it really does not get better than the RAF. </p> <p>Thanks for great times!</p> <p>Craig Fuller<br>Easton, Maryland</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:35% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="760" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-760x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14744 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-760x1024.png 760w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-223x300.png 223w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller-768x1034.png 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Craig-Fuller.png 917w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Craig Fuller took his first private aircraft flight in a float plane with his father at age 14 during a vacation in Bend, Oregon.&nbsp;That&#8217;s when he committed to becoming a pilot.&nbsp;Training in Northern California while in high school, he flew aircraft for the next 50 years. There was a bit of time off during his White House years (1981-1989) when most of the time aloft was provided by Air Force One or Two.&nbsp;Combining a passion for flying and politics, he was selected to lead AOPA in 2008. It was during his tenure that he joined the RAF and varied&nbsp;his flying from Husky to a Citation jet, along with several aircraft in between. He remains a supporter of RAF and champions the cause at every opportunity.</p> </div></div> ]]>

Like Ben Ryan, Airman Feiler survived bailing out of his aircraft, which created a meaningful connection for Joe, and worthy of his substantial contribution. He drew upon his father’s footlocker full&nbsp;of&nbsp;combat reports and photos for the message on the plaque.</p> <p>Joe says he “came to flying late, compared to some.” He learned to fly in Casper’s infamous wind, partnered on a Cessna 182, got involved with the Civil Air Patrol, then bought his Cardinal. “It was a breakthrough moment in my life,” he says. “I suddenly realized how accessible the backcountry is. The airplane gives you the ability to get out early, set up camp, and you have the rest of the day to recreate.” He admits the Cardinal is not commonly thought of as a backcountry plane, but with attention to conditions, it has taken Joe and his wife Julie into many Idaho and Montana backcountry fields.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of all his outdoor passions, “None of it has given me more enjoyment than aviation,” he says.&nbsp;For 35 years he taught Career and Technical education, including woodworking, carpentry and welding. “When I got my pilot license, I was told it was my ticket to learn, and my chance to constantly improve my skills,&#8221; a clear parallel to his approach during his teaching career.&nbsp;</p> <p>Joe has memberships in other professional and sport organizations, and says, “All organizations have their mission, but what separates the RAF from other organizations is the&nbsp;great people. They&nbsp;share a passion for aviation and work hard toward common goals. I’ve never met a better group of people who enjoy working on a common cause, then enjoy sharing the fruits of their labor.”</p> <p>Joe can be reached at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jfeiler@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jfeiler@theraf.org</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on August 15, 2023.</em></p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

By December 2003, the RAF had the credentials to solicit tax-deductible donations. “Jerry was one of those who stepped up and said, “I got this,” and his knowledge and follow-through were invaluable, laying the groundwork for success,” RAF Chairman John McKenna says. Jerry then volunteered to take on the vital task of Secretary/Treasurer on the RAF board.</p> <p>During fundraising efforts for backcountry airstrips, Jerry and his wife Liz, both animal lovers, donated dog sled rides around their Lincoln, Montana home. “By the end of 2004, we had about $15,000 in the bank and a roster of several hundred,” Jerry recalls. By the time he retired from that role eight years later, RAF membership had grown to several thousand, from all fifty states and about a dozen foreign countries. “I was spending ten to fourteen hours almost every day trying to keep up with it,” he adds. “It’s extremely satisfying to observe how the RAF is progressing and growing.”</p> <p>Jerry and Liz purchased their retirement ranch a few miles west of Lincoln in 1990 and are devoted to their horses. Liz is a published author<a href="http://www.elizabethcainauthor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>www.elizabethcainauthor.com</em></a>, and is passionate about poetry, music, and horses. She campaigned by horseback around her Montana House District during her two runs for State Representative.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Cain’s ranch purchase included a hangar at the Lincoln Airport, S69. This motivated Jerry to earn his pilot license in 1993. Having recently sold his Cessna 182, Jerry still keeps his Husky in his hangar there, and</p> <p>organizes an annual barbecue potluck in July for the local and flying community. Fly-in visitors are invited to camp in the adjacent campground along the Blackfoot River, and hike or bicycle the short distance into town and tour the unique “Blackfoot Pathways Sculpture In The Wild.” Montana Aeronautics Director Tim Conway says, “Although much of the [airport] funding is provided by the FAA and Montana Aeronautics Division, most of the labor is provided by a network of local volunteers, headed up by Jerry. The volunteers play an important role as the airport’s eyes and ears to maintain its safety and usability.” In 2019, Jerry&nbsp;formed the Lincoln Airport Foundation (LAF) as a 501(c)(3) public charity to formally assist the state in the maintenance and improvement of Lincoln Airport. Since then, the airport has remained open year round. Snow storms may close it – only until the volunteers immediately take on plowing to re-open it.</p> <p>Jerry serves as a volunteer pilot for Pilots N Paws, flying shelter dogs to their new homes. Since 2017, he has personally taken on the task of coordinating rescue flights throughout the northwest&nbsp;(WA, OR, ID, MT, and WY) to and from all over the country, successfully completing transports five to six times each month. He recommends that pilots register with PNP<a href="http://www.pilotsnpaws.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>www.pilotsnpaws.org</em></a>.</p> <p>Jerry still loves backcountry flying in his Husky, and as RAF Director Emeritus, Jerry monitors RAF activities. “I could not be more proud of the RAF’s accomplishments, the Directors, and all the other volunteers who make this all possible through their generous support of both their time and their dollars. The RAF is now nationally recognized as the ‘go to’ organization for anything related to recreational and backcountry airstrips.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on August 10, 2023.</em></p> <p><em>By Carmine Mowbray</em></p> ]]>

Through the hard work of many, N41 exists today and has earned its right to be preserved so that future generations of aviators can experience true grassroots aviation,” RAF Connecticut Ambassador Brian Thomas says.</p> <p>In that spirit, Brian applied for, and was awarded an RAF grant for improvements to the airfield including a low-maintenance composting outhouse, picnic tables, several park style barbecue grills and upgrades to the two existing fire pits. The level grounds dotted with shade trees make it an ideal place to escape the hustle and bustle for a weekend of flying around the countryside, enjoying a campfire, and nature. “We aim to achieve this goal and we are well on our way with last year’s addition of tent platforms, fire pits, mountains of stacked firewood provided by the local pilot community, as well as activities to focus attention on this great place.”&nbsp;</p> <p>He reports that the airfield has seen a resurgence of aviators seeking the quiet rolling hills of Connecticut “and this emerald strip of grass nestled in them.” Brian and RAF Connecticut Liaison Drew Lyons, and Ambassadors Greg Delp and DJ Nicholson have arranged for volunteer help from the EAA chapters from Meriden and Whelen Farms, and cooperation from N41 co-owners/managers Ken Kilcourse and John Seymour, and local pilots. Gravel for the project will be donated by a local pilot and owner of Segalla Sand and Gravel. Brian expects the projects to take two to three weekends beginning July 15.</p> <p>Other goals include general cleanup, removal of downed tree limbs from winter storms, mowing, weed whacking, and rubbish removal. “There will be no shortage of work to go around,” Brian says. “Waterbury airport – affectionately known as Mount Tobe – is one of the few remaining truly grassroots airports left in the State of Connecticut,” Brian says. “With each passing year land becomes more valuable and generational airports such as N41 disappear. Ken Kilcourse and John Seymour have made it their life mission to preserve this idyllic airport and generously share it with the pilot community. Preserving, improving, and creating spaces such as N41 is the bedrock of the RAF mission.” For more information on Waterbury, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;GvckXBxkfdSQTpFBNzKI">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 19, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is by Julie Boatman, <em>the editor-in-chief for Flying Media Group</em>. </em></p> <p>A Mountain Mentor: The RAF provides more than just support for our favorite places to fly.</p> <p>Mountain checkouts ranked among my favorite dual sessions to fly during the years after college that I spent instructing in Colorado out of the Boulder Municipal Airport—then 1V5, now KBDU, a change I find hilarious. We’d fly to Aspen (KASE), Leadville (KLXV), and Steamboat Springs (KSBS), which will always hold a special place in my heart—both for its bountiful slopes and stunningly beautiful summer marathon.</p> <p>I spent more than a decade based in Colorado, with every flight managing relatively high field elevations and density altitude performance reductions. Not having to lean during the runup still feels a bit strange to me today when flying in the flatlands.</p> <p>But by and large those airports we’d fly into west of the Continental Divide were all paved—and well used. Though they each had their elements of objective hazard, none—not even Glenwood Springs (KGWS now) with its shortish runway and mostly one-way ops—could qualify as remote or unimproved. Therefore, I treated the transition I would make into the true backcountry with a lot of respect, because I had seen firsthand how insidious those high-country hazards can be, and how quickly the risks multiply with carelessness or neglect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s also why I find the work that the Recreational Aviation Foundation does so valuable. The group reaches far beyond its considerable efforts to retain access and establish and maintain places to land in every state. RAF members serve as counselors and guides to those wishing to explore these marvelous lands from the air—and with minimal impact as compared to land-based transportation, I might add.</p> <p>My introduction to the types of places RAF protects began in 2005, and though my teachers weren’t all RAF mentors per se, the model they collectively presented lies in the same vein.&nbsp;</p> <p>In October 2005, I went flying on a mountain course with Lori MacNichol out of McCall, Idaho. After detailed airwork understanding her 180 hp Cessna 172’s specific performance, we headed first to Johnson Creek (3U2). Then she worked us to progressively more challenging terrain and approaches: Soldier Bar (85U), Wilson Bar (C48), and Cabin Creek (I08) in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. I learned immeasurably from each one, taking pieces I could incorporate into my flying, and techniques I still practice to this day.</p> <p>Flash forward to October 2019, and I found myself in a beginner’s mindset again under the tutelage of Fred Williams on a WomanWise Adventure Week in Cascade, Idaho. He introduced me first to his backcountry version of the Kitfox—an amazing tool—and then worked me into progressively more “interesting” places. The next day I flew with Stacey Budell in her stock Cessna 182, and though Stanley (2U7) and Smiley Creek (U87) were “easy”—save for the bear and cubs passing along the perimeter—the approaches into Idaho City (U98) and Garden Valley (U88) kicked it up a notch. Again, the tools that these sessions with experienced instructors added to my box of tricks and have served me so well, so far.</p> <p>Two RAF-connected mentors have taught me even more. In October 2020, Steve Taylor not only introduced me to his beautiful bouncing beach ball of a Republic SeaBee, but also to his Cessna “184 a half” in which we plied around the San Juans near Seattle in search of ghosts and glaciers and marionberry pie.</p> <p>My latest off-airport adventures I shared last August in eastern Washington state with Brad Damm at CubCrafters—to landing sites without names. The time we spent talking and thinking and flying drove home the unique nature of these spaces once more.</p> <p>The mentorship from these pilots goes beyond the hard skills and techniques you learn. There’s an overall philosophy you absorb through the behaviors they model—the respect for the airplane, the terrain, the land, and the people around you. You might venture out to an RAF-supported strip using the guidance you find on their website, but I encourage you to get to know the teachers within the group from whom you can learn so much.</p> <p></p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="750" height="683" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Julie-Boatmanc.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-14470 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Julie-Boatmanc.jpeg 750w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Julie-Boatmanc-300x273.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Julie Boatman learned to fly at a private strip in Iowa starting in high school.

The short runway (04/24) at the Ranger Station turns 92 this year. The runways were created with heavy equipment brought in piece by&nbsp;piece and reassembled, but once the Wilderness Act was signed in 1964, mechanized equipment was no longer allowed. The last known grading of either of the airstrips at Moose Creek was around 1958 when the long runway (01/19) was completed. Neither of the runways has had significant work done since &#8211; a testament to how&nbsp;well they were designed and constructed but also a witness to the low impact of aircraft on the landscape. After 60+ years, they are showing some wear &#8211; primarily due to water erosion. &nbsp;</p> <p>Because the Wilderness Act restricts mechanized tools, everything now must be done with hand tools or by a mule team pulling 19th century equipment.&nbsp;Three years ago, the RAF began assembling a plan with the Forest Service to do some needed maintenance on both runways. Using rural airstrip funding, the RAF began the effort this June, by hiring a Montana Conservation Corps (MCC) trail crew (funded by AmeriCorps) to help move dirt onto the low areas of both runways and create water diversions to prevent erosion. Just in time, Daher offered to help&nbsp;with&nbsp;the project by donating the use of one of their Kodiaks, and, as a result,&nbsp;equipment donated by Dave Normandeau of Thompson Falls, MT, (along with Dan and Pete Normandeau), and&nbsp;a&nbsp;runway crew&nbsp;were moved&nbsp;into Moose Creek&nbsp;in two days rather than weeks by&nbsp;other&nbsp;means. Over two days, the MCC crew along with RAF volunteers, moved 54 loads of soil from the tree line to the centerline of both airstrips, a water bar was installed at the head of runway 24, and a new windsock was installed at the other end. Pilot reports&nbsp;have since&nbsp;noted&nbsp;these improvements.&nbsp;The RAF isn’t done &#8211; but we have taken a big step forward. Next comes some heavier work with&nbsp;a&nbsp;mule team and dirt moving equipment.</p> <p>This is a great example of how the RAF operates. The spirit of volunteerism is recognized by others who then join in to help make a project a reality. It all starts,&nbsp;though,&nbsp;with our volunteers who commit hours of time to make these projects a success:</p> <p>Sparky Parker &#8211; RAF Idaho State Liaison<br>Steve Johnson &#8211; RAF Idaho Ambassador<br>Larry Taylor &#8211; RAF Idaho Supporter and former Chairman of Idaho Aviation Foundation<br>Ed Kronfuss &#8211; RAF Montana Supporter<br>Dave Irvin ( IAA District 7 Director)<br>Dave, Dan and Pete Normandeau, who donated dirt moving tools for the mule team.<br>Our volunteer Kodiak Pilots who put in hours of flying tools and teams<br>Steve Taylor &#8211;

He received his private pilot license shortly after graduating from Texas A&amp;M University where he was in the Air Force ROTC and the Fightin&#8217; Texas Aggie Band. John currently owns a ‘41 Stearman biplane and a variety of other aircraft, including a ‘78 Woody Pusher, RV4, &#8217;76 Citabria, ’64 Baron and a &#8217;56 T-28C. John’s love of flying prompted him to build an 1800’ grass runway on his ranch in 2006, and he has embarked on many flying adventures from there ever since.</p> <p id="block-f84ccdf0-530e-4ff5-9a0f-23955766a1da">One of John’s most memorable aviation experiences was flying a CAF World War II fighter plane, the P-39Q Airacobra, to Oshkosh AirVenture in 2022 to honor 100-year-old WWII Triple Ace Bud Anderson. A historic formation flight with Bud flying in the back of a P-51 with all three of his fighters (P-39Q, P-51B and P-51D) decorated as OLD CROW off his wing topped off the event.</p> <p>John owned a commercial general contracting firm for many years and served as a Texas State Representative from 2015-2023. He currently runs a consulting company called Someday Strategies. He is on the General Staff for the Commemorative Air Force and is Chair of the San Marcos Airport Advisory Board, Founder of the Lockhart Flying Club, Past Chair of the TX Legislature GA Caucus for 6 years, and a Lifetime member of AOPA, EAA and CAF.</p> <p>John became involved with the RAF in 2015 as a supporter, and that same year, co-authored a bill to add aviation language to the Texas Recreational Use Statute. The bill did not pass, but he received an Attorney General’s opinion substantiating that protection for aviation already existed within the RUS. In recent years he has helped Texas Liaison Tres Clinton with a variety of efforts, including revitalizing several airstrip gems in West Texas. John also worked with Texas Parks and Wildlife to create a MOU with the RAF to help foster future runways and camping sites. Moving forward, he is enthusiastic about serving as a Co-Liaison with Tres to advance the RAF mission.</p> <p>&#8220;The RAF combines my two passions in life of flying and providing people access to the great outdoors,&#8221; John said. &#8220;I am thrilled to be a part of this fantastic organization and look forward to helping serve its supporters into the next twenty years.&#8221;</p> ]]>

From flying his Cessna 185 off his own airfield, to the slower pace of trolling for fish in his kayak.</p> <p>For many summers, Dan and his wife Margie flew their SuperCub on floats to his family’s rustic fly-in fishing lodge on Prill Lake in Saskatchewan. The couple treated fly-in guests to comfortable rooms, mornings fishing in the lake, abundant meals of fresh-caught walleye, Margie’s homemade blueberry pies, and a cooler full of adult beverages, all flown in.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 17%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Dan found time to learn to play the fiddle, and enjoys bluegrass music. At the time of this writing, he and his son Ted are preparing to fly the RV-7 that they completed in his shop at home in Sand Coulee. Their youngest son’s family lives close by, and their daughter is fulfilling a Navy career, currently based in San Diego.</p> </div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="714" height="930" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-8.52.48-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14685 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-8.52.48-AM.png 714w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-8.52.48-AM-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /></figure></div> <p>Engineering runs in Dan’s family, and Ted and his twin brother Tom surprised Dan with a custom fabricated kayak trailer that he uses in Montana and Arizona to enjoy river and lake fishing. Dan and Margie also find great sport plying the Arizona, California, and Nevada deserts on their side-by-side, basing out of Quartzsite, Arizona in the winter.</p> <p>A founding director of the Recreational Aviation Foundation, Dan served on its board for ten years; eight years as Vice President. “The RAF is especially proud of Dan’s work throughout the approval and construction of Russian Flat airstrip in Montana’s Lewis and Clark National Forest,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The RAF has always taken the ‘high road’ when dealing with policy makers. Our data is science based, and we approach issues in a kind and courteous manner,” Dan says. That approach had results, and in cooperation with the Montana Pilots Association, and the USFS District Ranger, the first new airstrip on U.S. Forest Service land in over forty years was opened for public use. Dan stayed on the task throughout seven years of meetings and two more years of construction, with all RAF and MPA volunteer labor. His efforts earned him an RAF Golden Pulaski Award, which honors exceptional volunteers for their hard work on behalf of the RAF.</p> <p>“While working in Montana, we formed our mission and learned the right way to do things,” Dan says. The RAF then used those principles to advance its mission throughout the country. Early on, Dan was asked to accompany McKenna and other RAF volunteers to meet officially with federal lands managers in Washington, D.C. He met a half dozen times face-to-face with decision makers, always wearing the signature orange RAF shirt. On one of the trips, he and McKenna were invited to a formal Senate reception. McKenna looked at Dan in his orange shirt and jeans.&nbsp;</p> <p>“You packed a white shirt, tie, and jacket?” McKenna asked.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dan took a cab to the closest menswear store, took out his credit card and bought new black shoes, slacks, white shirt and sport jacket to be appropriately dressed. “I did buy an orange tie,” he quipped. His time and expense paid off. As a result of those meetings, the USFS Planning Rule now acknowledges the importance of recreational aviation.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:19% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="928" height="944" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-11.35.33-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14686 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-11.35.33-AM.png 928w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-11.35.33-AM-295x300.png 295w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-11-at-11.35.33-AM-768x781.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Margie is just as devoted to the RAF mission, and has helped staff many trade shows and events.

As Director Emeritus, Dan still advocates for the RAF. He urges others to “support the organization by volunteering or donating, and enjoy the resources of recreational and backcountry airstrips. It’s why we do this. It&#8217;s why we learned to fly, so go enjoy them,” he adds.</p> <p><em>Submitted July 14, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

MPA volunteers, MT Aeronautics staff, the occasional state aircraft and RAF volunteers mow the airstrip, tie-down and camping area, clean the R.T. Adkins Memorial outhouse, trim around cones, and cut dead timber that remains after the 2015 forest fire swept through.</p> <p>This year’s rains and low ceiling prevented flying in on Saturday morning, but six people had flown in early to help, and one determined volunteer, Trevert Adkins – son of the late R.T.

Whitelaw’s intention has been to tend to the field to keep it open.

On a recent weekend, four RAF volunteers and an excavator operator contributed two-and-a-half days of work.&nbsp;A new hole was dug for the outhouse vault, which was then set. The group then reset&nbsp;the outhouse building&nbsp;onto the new vault. They also set the new windsock pole and raised the windsock. R-2 Excavation&nbsp;hauled in 5 loads of gravel and spread it in the main parking area near the picnic tables to stabilize the soft sandy parking area. Additionally, the group added two more fire pits and one more picnic table to increase camping sites.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Avey-Field2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14333" width="301" height="308" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Avey-Field2.jpg 980w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Avey-Field2-294x300.jpg 294w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Avey-Field2-768x784.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></figure></div> <p>After their mower suffered a broken belt, the group used weed eaters to clean up the runway shoulders. Whitelaw said,&nbsp;&#8220;The&nbsp;runway and parking areas are in great shape along with the camping sites; firewood is abundant.&#8221;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Not only is&nbsp;Avey&nbsp;a convenient Washington-British Columbia border crossing, there’s hiking and deer and turkey hunting near the Kettle River which can be fished,” Whitelaw added.

The field offers many recreational opportunities, and volunteers will use the funds to install a new windsock, RAF fire ring, apply lime, and roll the runway to improve the surface.</p> <p>Henderson Field is a privately owned 2,410-ft grass strip.&nbsp;Visitors may enjoy camping, hiking, fishing, and swimming. Included is use of fire rings, firewood, picnic table, and access to a four-wheeler. Visitors may also use the canoe, kayak, or paddle boat to enjoy the adjacent lake. Running water and a toilet are available.&nbsp;Contact owner John Henderson at 618-201-0293&nbsp;or email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:flyn5@hotmail.com?subject=Query%20from%20Airfield.Guide%20about%20Henderson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flyn5@hotmail.com</a>.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/smoker-Henderson.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14406" width="335" height="250" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/smoker-Henderson.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/smoker-Henderson-300x224.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/smoker-Henderson-768x573.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></figure></div> <p>Volunteers and owners have already spent nine to twelve worker-days&nbsp;removing brush and trees in the approaches, runway edges, and around the campsite to enhance safety, according to Warner. Efforts are ongoing to remove undergrowth to improve the aesthetics of a shaded campsite area.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The goal would be to have all this accomplished before the end of August.” Warner said. “The intent is to have it ready for a fly-in event in late September or October. This will be an opportunity to try out the smoker provided by the owners,” he added. Warner also anticipates that a group will fly in to observe the April 8, 2024 solar eclipse.</p> <p>Find out&nbsp;more about Henderson Field in the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;AoJVcUvGMWiCKTfFbmkw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 15, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

Burwell, CEO of C&amp;B Operations, a network of John Deere dealerships throughout the Midwest, located a mower in Luverne, MN, a stone’s throw from the South Dakota border.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trouble is, you don’t just load the machine on a trailer, and drive it to the island in giant Lake Michigan. And it was too big to fly in. So the mower had to traverse 928 miles on land, then 32 more miles over open water, a distance the same as Alaska’s legendary Iditarod race from Anchorage to Nome. &nbsp;</p> <p>That’s when resourceful RAF volunteers rose to the challenge. RAF Director Jeff Russell of Wisconsin, RAF volunteer Jerry Ness, and RAF Michigan Liaison General Grant started making plans. Russell and RAF supporter Rick&nbsp;Rettler drove the 12 hour round trip from Wisconsin to Luverne and back.&nbsp;“We tested the mower locally, then General hauled it to Escanaba, Michigan.&nbsp;Jerry hauled it to Leland, where Geoff Niesink, a contractor with a landing craft boat, waited for relatively flat water. He was able to ship it to the island on May&nbsp;12,” Russell explained.&nbsp;“And it was a relay all the way.”&nbsp; Accompanying Geoff on the boat ride were Jerry and longtime RAF volunteer George Stevens.</p> <p>Grant and other volunteers had previously flown into North Fox Island, 6Y3 to prepare an addition to the tool storage shed to accommodate the equipment. While they were there, they cut up trees that had fallen on the trails to the beach from the ends of the airfield.&nbsp;</p> <p>A second pull-behind mower was also purchased and delivered to the Island.&nbsp;The two mowers can be combined for a ten-foot-wide cutting swath, saving many hours of mowing on the 3,000 x 100-ft airfield and camping areas.</p> <p>&#8220;I like the saying, ‘Many&nbsp;hands make light work,’ and it&nbsp;couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate in describing this mission,” Russell said. “From the generosity of Peter [Burwell] to all the folks that helped with the relay delivery, it was an RAF team effort that got it done,” he added.</p> <p>For information on North Fox Island, see the <a

And I not now, when?” Chuck has always practiced good backcountry ethics, saying, “Pilots must respect other people’s values just as we expect them to show consideration for our means of wilderness access.”</p> <p>Chuck was raised in Erie, PA, but was born with a Western heart. Between terms at Hotchkiss boarding school, and four years at college, he made his way to Wyoming and Montana working as a ranch hand to learn ranching from the ground up. After finishing his Agricultural degree at Cornell, plus additional course work at Montana State University in the range management department, he found his place and bought a ranch west of Polson in Western Montana.</p> <p>Chuck and his wife Penny have always worked side-by-side, whether it’s raising cattle, or contributing to community events. Penny was known for her crew dinners and homemade pies. She founded the Greater Polson Community Foundation, a thriving nonprofit, and she continues serving in an emeritus role.</p> <p>Jareckis bought their brand new Cessna 180 in 1976, and have logged thousands of hours together traversing most of the Western Hemisphere, including flights to the East Coast, venturing as far as Labrador, three and-a-half time zones from home. Escaping Montana’s winters, they often flew to Mexico, even as far south as Panama. Always searching for new challenges, Chuck mastered seaplane skills, and owned a Cessna 185 on Aerocet floats for a dozen years, exploring Alaska and Canada, making it all the way to the Arctic Ocean more than once. The 185 had a fuel-injected O-520. “I really hoped it started quickly after I untied and was adrift on the South Nahanni River just above Virginia Falls in the Northwest Territories,” he recalled. Luckily, it did!</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chuck-and-Penny-Jarecki-at-Arctic-Circle.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-14284" width="317" height="387" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chuck-and-Penny-Jarecki-at-Arctic-Circle.jpeg 480w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chuck-and-Penny-Jarecki-at-Arctic-Circle-246x300.jpeg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></figure></div> <p>Not many people from the Lower 48 can say they&#8217;ve landed at 49 Alaska locations from Anatuvuk Pass to Yakutat, as the Jareckis have. Venturing beyond the Western Hemisphere, Chuck and Penny have landed at 14 different places during a flying tour of Australia.</p> <p>Where did his passion for flying take root? His father was an avid pilot, and Chuck has fond memories of the stories of the cabin Waco his father and mother flew cross-country before he was born. Later, after WW II, Chuck’s father worked as a corporate pilot.</p> <p>The Jareckis have sold their ranch, and it remains a showplace of good range management. Having retired from his ranching career, Chuck had some time and a lot of knowledge to apply to the new RAF and its mission. His successful relationship with public land managers was a valuable asset, and Chuck was instrumental in saving the six BLM backcountry airstrips within the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument. “Chuck set us on a path toward productive conversation with the BLM and the results we were hoping for in those early days,” RAF co-founder and Chairman John McKenna said.</p> <p>When not on flying, trekking, or rafting adventures, Chuck has spent an incredible amount of time and energy making improvements at Ryan Field, too numerous to mention. From arranging the initial logging project, clearing areas for tie-downs, spraying weeds, obtaining, painting and placing the runway cones, “I stopped counting after I flew dozens of trips up there,” he says. Folks who’ve enjoyed the rustic Ryan pilot shelter, privy and his hand-crafted bear boxes, have Chuck and his occasional volunteers to thank. Many fun hours have been spent cooking and baking with the wood cookstove the Jareckis donated from their original ranch house, or frying steaks over the stone barbecue he built.</p> <p>Tackling another important task, Chuck drafted the RAF’s<em> Advocates’ Guide to Recreational Aviation, </em>and the companion reference, <em>Land Managers’ Guide to Airstrips on Public Lands</em>, which are valuable resources for the RAF Directors, Liaisons, and those overseeing public lands.</p> <p>A former director of Montana Pilots Association and co-founder of the RAF, Chuck’s philosophy helped craft the RAF Code of Ethics. “I am keenly aware of the struggles we, as advocates of recreational backcountry aviation, constantly endure to protect airstrips and our rights to use them. We must conduct ourselves in such a way to preserve flying opportunities for future generations,” he says. “Chuck’s early leadership and countless volunteer hours helped establish the RAF Way, and set it on a course for success,” McKenna added.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chuck-Jarecki-with-Cessna-Amphib.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14286" width="469" height="345" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chuck-Jarecki-with-Cessna-Amphib.png 565w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chuck-Jarecki-with-Cessna-Amphib-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted June 3, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is from Mike Todd, a career pilot and longtime RAF Supporter.</em></p> <p>You might think that it would get old and stale, this flying thing. Modern avionics make navigation accurate and easy, and we have equipment that monitors every parameter of the engine that keeps us safely in the air, warning us if something is amiss. We have auto flight systems available for our light airplanes, even old ones like my 1956 Cessna 180, that rival those that have taken us around the world in jets. We take pride in answering the challenge of keeping skills current and working with others in the air traffic system to operate safely in busy airspace. But even with all the help from modern devices and equipment, there is still romance in flight. There is still a special feel with that “almost perfect” touchdown on a grass runway, and the sound of the cylinders cooling when there is no other sound than those of nature. It’s been that way for fifty six years and well over thirty thousand hours for me, and you would think I’d get over it.&nbsp;</p> <p>But there is something special about flying in general, and flying in the United States of America in particular. While light airplane aviation is alive all around the world, it’s different here. We enjoy freedom of flight that is unique to only a few places in the world. Non flyers are sometimes surprised to find that I live next to a runway where I can fly whenever and pretty much wherever I choose, and back when I earned my living flying big airplanes, some of my compatriots looked at my pictures and listened to my stories of flying the backcountry with a curious look in their eye. Nowadays, I sometimes meet up with some of those airline friends in the back country. I’d like to think I had something to do with that.&nbsp;</p> <p>On a nice August morning last Summer, I loaded a few tools into our 180 and pushed it out of its hangar into pre-dawn light. Some of the neighbors heard the engine start up, and more of them heard us leave. The 180 isn’t quiet at takeoff power, but we wound the prop back a bit, and as it is in the backcountry, that sound has a nice decrescendo, fading to quiet in just a moment or two, so the sleepy-heads went back to dreams, or thoughts of driving to work.&nbsp;</p> <p>We climbed out over the Washington Cascades and put the autopilot to work, munching on a breakfast muffin as we watched the Big Bend country of the Columbia river transition to the western Rocky Mountains and river drainages of the Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Flathead. My good old friend, the 180 was a magic carpet, and the scenery below was a demonstration of all those things the Geology Professor told us about way back when we were young and in a hurry.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mission that morning was to join friends from the Recreational Aviation Foundation at a cabin raising party at Ryan Field, the place Ben and Butchie Ryan carved out of the rocks and trees on the west slope of the Flathead Range, just outside the entrance to Glacier National Park. The Ryan story is symbolic of the mission of the RAF. It’s a story of a loving couple who created a dream they wanted to keep alive, and an organization of people dedicated to making sure that happened. The Ryans are gone now, and the future of Ryan Field is protected under the stewardship of the RAF. The airstrip is still special and requires some backcountry skill and care, but that is part of the character of the place. And thanks to the hard work, imagination, and financial backing of volunteers and supporters a big timber frame barn, as well as a pilot shelter, and those rustic cabins make Ryan Field a truly unique experience.&nbsp;</p> <p>For many of us in the West, Ryan Field is the poster child for the mission of the RAF, but it’s just a bookend to what is happening with the organization, and thanks to the efforts of aviators and supporters across the land, great things are happening in the name of Recreational Aviation from Alaska to Florida and California to Maine. Congratulations to the RAF on the first twenty years.

He started flying in 1967, and his first plane, a somewhat neglected 1946 Aeronca Champ came out of the airport weeds and into his life when he was a junior in High School. College in the Midwest brought a degree in Aviation as well as his first flying job, and from there he was fortunate to make a living flying around the world, working up the ladder from Twin Otters in Alaska to 747&#8217;s at United. The old Champ introduced him to grass runways and backcountry places around the country, and seven years into retirement, those places, as well as the Super Cub and Cessna 180 that share his hangar with the old Champ continue to be his passions.</em></p> <p><em>Submitted on May 23, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

He makes a stunning image when he approaches a forest strip in his beautiful 1952 red Cessna 170B.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bill has served as RAF Ambassador, but has made the commitment to step up as Liaison, joining RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes. Bill also chairs the Oregon Pilots Association Backcountry Committee, and because Idaho shares a lot of outstanding backcountry with Oregon, he’s a district director for the Idaho Aviation Association. “I’m committed to keeping backcountry aviation in the forefront of our land managers’ minds and in their planning,” he says. “I want to do my part in helping to preserve those special places.”</p> <p>Raised in northeast Oregon, Bill was always interested in the outdoors. He graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Wildlife Science then completed a lengthy career as an Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife Officer, including 25 years as a backcountry game warden, which put him on horseback for several thousand miles of patrols, and his duty included operating drift boats, jet boats and kayaks on the Snake River and its tributaries. &nbsp;</p> <p>He earned his pilot license in 1975, and added commercial and instrument ratings. He has flown his wife Judy and their family into the backcountry throughout the Pacific Northwest, Canada and Alaska, and says, “Each of those trips is a treasure.”&nbsp;</p> <p>He’d given a lot of thought to a better way to secure his aircraft when tie-downs were nowhere to be found. The result was “Abe’s Aviation,” an enterprise he started in 2004 in his tidy workshop in his hangar at the (yep!) Enterprise, Oregon Municipal Airport, (8S4). “I wanted our tie-downs to work for all types of airplanes as well as helicopters. I wanted quality to be paramount in our products for many years of service,” he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Bill isn’t flying, fishing, hunting, or manufacturing tie-downs, he plays some golf, and invites fellow golfers to join him at Alpine Meadows Golf Course, close to the airport. “It’s a beautiful 9-hole course that will challenge anyone with its water and trees,” he says. “If you’re flying in to pick up a tie-down kit, you’ll save the cost of shipping and the round of golf is on me!”</p> <p><a href="mailto:bables@theraf.org">bables@theraf.org</a></p> <p>541-263-1327</p> ]]>

Ron, of Polson, Montana built a beautiful 1947 Aeronca Chief and now enjoys flying his own plane. He began flying in 1962 between junior and senior high school years, and earned his license. Ron’s wife Kathi earned her private license shortly after high school, as well, learning from her father who was an instructor. They made an interesting couple, flying together in their early years together.</p> <p>Their son Brett joined the Marine Corps on graduation from high school and was an airframe mechanic on the Harrier jump jet for his five-year tour.&nbsp;During college, Brett joined the Montana Army Air Guard. He earned his ATP and flew for Envoy Air (American Airlines’ largest regional) for a few years before flying Blackhawks full-time for the Guard. “I always supported Brett’s desire to participate in aviation,” Ron says.&nbsp;“Last summer he got his tailwheel endorsement in my Aeronca.”</p> <p>Ron’s 32-year military career includes a year-and-a-half as combat engineer, Special Forces. He was assigned to the National Guard as an active duty advisor to Company C 19th Special Forces, reenlisted, and attended State OCS and was an A-team commander for two years. In the Reserves he spent 16 years evaluating guard and reserve units for readiness; and nine years as executive officer and commander of an Engineer Battalion.</p> <p>A cup of coffee at Polson Airport led to Ron’s involvement in the RAF in 2004. He met RAF co-founder Chuck Jarecki, who took him along to RAF organizational meetings, work parties, and meetings with public agencies.&nbsp;In 2005 the RAF recruited Ron for its Montana State Liaison, one of the earliest to wear the signature orange shirt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ron brings vast skills to the RAF, having majored in Forest Engineering, specializing in Photogrammetry/Cartography. While in college he was a smokejumper, Forest Service Indian liaison officer and forestry technician. On graduation, he joined the US Geological Survey, doing field surveys. He spent two years in Washington, DC in top secret work; then transferred to Denver’s Cartography division where he participated in the transition from manual to digital mapping. He wrapped up his lengthy career with the US Forest Service as Cartography/Photogrammetry supervisor.</p> <p>“Eventually, I found myself doing more consulting with other RAF Liaisons on public agency matters. I discussed this with RAF President Bill McGlynn and he suggested I become the RAF Public Agency Consultant. I handle calls for guidance almost every week,” Ron says. And other RAF Liaisons are grateful for his experience and help.</p> <p>“I hope to participate in a new program the Forest Service has initiated called ‘Re-imagine Recreation.’ The object is to create a plan for recreation, addressing the great numbers of visitors to the National Forests, and the change in recreational emphasis,” he says. His pursuit of the RAF mission will be part of Ron’s approach.</p> <p>Ron has another passion. Golf – but with a cartographer’s passion. “My one other consuming interest is golf course measurement,” Ron says, explaining his intent. &#8220;Establishing a difficulty rating for the golf course. In conjunction with an individual’s handicap, it would allow fair competition between players of different skill levels.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on May 12, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

Some volunteers stayed and worked at Dug Bar while others flew off to work on airstrip maintenance at Big Bar, 1DA; and Sluice Creek, O68. Runways were mowed, weeds were whacked in parking areas, runway marker rocks were painted, and new windsocks were installed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Around noon folks started returning to Dug Bar after completing tasks at the other airstrips. Mona Williams, retired Wallowa County District Attorney and Circuit Court Judge prepared a hearty lunch for everyone. Mona was born and raised in Wallowa County, but had never been to Dug Bar. “It was a classic win-win for Mona and the other volunteers. Great food for everyone and her first time flight into Hells Canyon,” Ables said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Reflecting on the day of collaboration&nbsp;with&nbsp;Idaho Aviation Association and Oregon Pilots Association, Ables said, “We appreciate all of the folks who came, many who have&nbsp;given endless hours of their time at many of these events in the past.&#8221;&nbsp;</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/> <p><strong><em>About Hells Canyon</em></strong></p> <p>What is Hells Canyon and the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative (HCRC)?</p> <p>Hells Canyon is North America’s&nbsp;<em>deepest</em>&nbsp;river gorge. There are six primitive airstrips in Hells Canyon National Recreation Area along the Snake River, preserved for public use: Dug Bar, Cache Creek, Salmon Bar, Ragtown Bar, Big Bar and Sluice Creek.</p> <p>The HCRC is a 501(c)3 formed in 2016, composed of eight major groups: rafters, jet boaters, aviators, motorized recreationalists, commercial outfitters, backcountry horsemen, citizens-at-large, and local government and the U.S. Forest Service. Idaho Congressman Russ Fulcher honored the Collaborative within the Congressional Record in 2022. In part he stated, “Our country is blessed with abundant natural resources . . .The governance of those resources is the responsibility of all of us – to make our outdoor spaces manageable and accessible for the enjoyment of all.” He included&nbsp;several&nbsp;mentions&nbsp;of&nbsp;aviation, and concluded the proclamation by saying, “I am proud to highlight the men and women who stepped up and made a difference for the benefit of all users in the Hells Canyon River area.”</p> <p>The RAF is pleased that Congressman Fulcher recognized the efforts and results of the HCRC, and memorialized it in his official proclamation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bill Ables, an RAF Oregon Liaison, serves as one of its co-chairs.&nbsp;Ables said, “The neat thing about this collaboration is that decisions are made by all kinds of user groups.&#8221;&nbsp;RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes was an early proponent of the RAF’s involvement in HCRC, and was awarded an RAF grant toward its steering committee to clarify the RAF mission within HCRC goals.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG-1394_2_40-794x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14018" width="642" height="828" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG-1394_2_40-794x1024.jpg 794w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG-1394_2_40-233x300.jpg 233w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG-1394_2_40-768x991.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG-1394_2_40.jpg 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted on May 15, 2023.</em></p> <p><em>Top photo courtesy of Amanda Rahn.</em></p> ]]>

(You’ll need an Oregon angling license.) “The airstrip boasts the Owyhee Hilton cabin for folks to overnight in, but if you skip setting up your tent in favor of using the cabin, be prepared for some four-legged varmints,” he added, advising visitors to use their tent unless it is an emergency.&nbsp;</p> <p>Owyhee is a good example of cooperation between aviation groups. The recreational appeal of the airstrip, and its proximity to Idaho attracts the interest of both Oregon and Idaho volunteers. The strip received a day of maintenance by Idaho Aviation Association and Willowa County Pilots Association volunteers and RAF supporters, coordinated by Aaron Hassamere, IAA Activities VP. He reported that the turnout was great on a sunny April 29th. Nineteen folks relocated the outhouse, removed rocks from the runway surface; some installed a new windsock, cleared brush and gave the “Owyhee Hilton” a bit of TLC.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hassamere reports that there are numerous goathead plants – also called puncturevine – in the area. The mat-forming plant&nbsp;produces sharp spines that can injure humans and animals, as well as puncture bicycle tires.&nbsp;Eradication of&nbsp;these noxious weeds&nbsp;is on the list of projects to tackle in the future.</p> <p>The State of Oregon owns the strip and advises contacting 502-378-4880 prior to use. The airport is surrounded by high terrain and is subject to high temperatures in the summer.&nbsp;The dirt road into the airstrip is called “Deadman Gulch Road” which a cautious person might consider when planning a visit.</p> <p><a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;oNQmHkMcqLRHNTJxnnix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here</a>&nbsp;is more info about 28U in the Airfield Guide.</p> <p><em>Submitted on May 15, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is from Jim Hanson, a career aviator and longtime RAF Supporter.</p> <p><strong>The RAF Turns 20</strong>:</p> <p>There is so much to be proud of on this 20th anniversary of the RAF! Searching for a way to illustrate this, it occurred to me that creating a large organization or business is <strong>much like bringing up your own child.</strong> YOU gave it life – YOU molded it into the success it has become. The success of the RAF is a reflection on YOU, the<em> “parents.”</em> Here are some lessons learned from my own parents, who brought up six kids, applicable to starting and managing a business, or an organization like the RAF:</p> <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li>When the “baby” is young, it is all-consuming; you think about it every waking minute, and in turn, it keeps you up all night.</li> <li>In the beginning, the “baby” needs to be changed—A LOT!</li> <li>As it gets older, it starts to develop its own personality and identity—with or without your input.</li> <li>The saying “it takes a village to raise a child” couldn’t be more true—you need help and input from many people.</li> <li>The “older kids” help bring up the “younger kids”—imparting “tribal knowledge” and wisdom to the younger kids, as well as helping out the parents.</li> <li>As an adolescent, the kid thinks he or she knows everything, and will only find out after making mistakes that they do not.</li> <li>As your “youngster” matures, you take increasing pride in their accomplishments.</li> <li>As it reaches adulthood, your “child” has fully assumed its own identity, and you realize it can function without you. You can <em>(and should)</em> be proud of that fact!</li> </ol> <p><strong>That has certainly been the case with the RAF!</strong></p> <p>To continue the analogy of a person or organization growing from a young child to an adult, I offer the following examples from my parents <em>(and you likely heard it from your own). Whether bringing up kids, or starting a business or organization, these attributes are applicable:</em></p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>“Always associate with people smarter than you” <em>(in my case, that isn’t a problem!).</em></li> <li>“Don’t make promises you can’t keep”.</li> <li>“Under-promise, and Over-deliver!”</li> <li>“Don’t be afraid to ask for help—we all need it at some time, and you can learn from the failures of others.”</li> <li>“By helping others, you often help yourself.”</li> <li>You have one chance to make a “First Impression”.</li> <li>The most valuable commodity you have is people’s confidence in you to “do the right thing”—don’t let them down.</li> <li>“Just because _____ acts that way doesn’t mean YOU have to! Be your own person!”.</li> <li>“Do a few things, but do them well.”</li> <li>“Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—we all make them—but be sure to learn from your mistakes.”</li> <li>“Much can be accomplished if you don’t care WHO gets the credit!”</li> <li>“Respect (and reputation) is earned, not granted.”</li> <li>“It’s not WHO you know—it’s who knows <em>YOU</em>—and <em>what you stand for!</em>”</li> <li>“If you ever want to make a friend, ask THEM to do YOU a favor!&#8221;</li> <li>Those that give themselves so their progeny can have a better life are to be admired—<em>“the kids are gonna be alright!”</em></li> </ul> <p><strong>I would have to say that the RAF “checks all of the boxes” when it comes to dealing with others. Perhaps these are the secrets to their success!</strong></p> <p></p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SgWjDuAqc5mJH1PYDOSErXzKXYbPKDXD/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here to read about how the RAF aided aviation in Minnesota, which is when Jim first got involved with the RAF</a>.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:38% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="462" height="302" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_0928.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13892 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_0928.jpg 462w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_0928-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Jim has been flying for 60 years and been in the FBO business for 54 years.

His father was participating in a remote control sailplane competition and brought him to the flying field that day. He eventually grew up and also competed in remote control sailplane competitions, ultimately qualifying to represent the U.S. junior team and placing 2nd in the world for the FAI Aeromodeling F3J competition held in Finland (2002). </p> <p>Christopher never lost his passion for aviation, but instead pursued a college degree in business finance, later received a Master’s in accounting, and finally became a CPA. He used these credentials and hard work to secure employment at Toyota where he has worked in finance since 2007. Christopher is a CFI SEL, and outside of working hours, volunteers his skills to help pilots time-build. He shares his knowledge of night flight operations and cross-country flight planning with the goal of making less experienced pilots safer. Through these efforts, he has been blessed with many new friendships.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, Christopher will attempt to pivot to professional pilot. The view from the flight deck never gets old, and there is always a new friend to meet for the first time. There are also always challenges to face that keep him on his toes. Christopher intends to continue sharing his love for piloting and passion for aviation with others with the goal of spreading awareness of this incredible industry.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted May 12, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

Keller arrived on Thursday, towing the large New Mexico Pilots Association enclosed trailer with tools and some modern conveniences. “I stopped at every cattle guard on the dusty county road – eleven total – to verify each was at least fourteen feet wide to be sure the semi-truck can deliver the vault toilet to the Rain Creek trailhead,” Keller said, in advance of its installation scheduled in the fall. Keller dragged the runway and set up camp in anticipation of the other volunteers’ arrival.&nbsp;</p> <p>Friday the winds prevented anyone flying in, so RAF Supporter and NMPA member Randy Roth drove his Jeep to Sacaton with NMPA member Jim Gosney. “The three of us got busy painting the segmented circle around the RAF windsock,” Keller said. “The circle is made from the repurposed large rocks that had formed an “X” in the middle of the old dormant runway,” he explained. They tossed rocks from the runway that had been dislodged by the dragging process. All but Keller drove back home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Saturday’s weather was perfect, so Randy and Jim flew the 30-minute flight back to Sacaton, followed by RAF Supporter and NMPA President John Lorenz, arriving after his two-hour flight.</p> <p>With the painting complete, they tossed more rocks and hand-cut channels for water drainage. “John and I checked out the Rain Creek Trail into the Gila Wilderness, America&#8217;s first federally designated wilderness. It will celebrate one hundred years in 2024,” Keller pointed out. He reports that the mile and-a-half trail to the crossing at Rain Creek is narrow and challenging.</p> <p>They packed up camp and returned home Sunday, leaving Sacaton in much better condition. Prior to landing, permission is required by calling USFS Gila Dispatch Center at 800-538-1644. At its 6,200-ft elevation, pilots should be mindful of density altitude.

The field is owned by Bob Davis of Orient, WA, and is adjacent to a Washington-British Columbia Port-Of-Entry. Customs agents are nearby making this strip convenient for travelers to and from Canada.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each spring, Whitelaw organizes volunteers to haul in a mower and string trimmers to maintain the edges of the airstrip and camping area.</p> <p>“This RAF grant will improve a fly-in only campground, located in a wooded area offering hiking and deer and turkey hunting near the Kettle River which can be fished,” Whitelaw said. “This project, along with the work we did two years ago will help keep this strip open,” he added. The grant will fund improvements to the camping area, the installation of an additional windsock, hauling and leveling gravel to stabilize airplane parking, and re-setting the existing outhouse on a new precast concrete vault.</p> <p>Due to sandy soil along the runway, aircraft parking near the camp area is unsafe. “The contractor offered to donate his time and equipment to spread and level the gravel,” Whitelaw explained.</p> <p>Volunteers will build the new windsock pole out of pipe material, haul it to the airfield, dig the mounting hole, and hand fill it with Sakrete. Whitelaw procured another picnic table and firepit from the National Park Service that he will haul and place to improve the camp area. “The onsite work is projected to take two days, starting in mid to late May,” Whitelaw said. Watch for the new bright orange RAF windsock at Avey Field!</p> <p>For more information on Avey field, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/ef68a290-a9dc-49fa-ac05-267db6217b15/overview?searchQuery=Avey">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on April 25, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is from Joe Brown, the Chairman of Hartzell Propeller.</em></p> <p><strong>An RAF Flatlander Reflects on Good Fortune</strong>: </p> <p>Eight years ago I was standing in a stranger’s crowded living room in Bozeman, Montana.</p> <p>Members of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association were gathered with a large group of RAF members who were hosting us for a weekend in the backcountry. About half the folks in the room were meeting for the first time.</p> <p>One of the RAF members greeted us and said something I haven’t forgotten: “We are a campfire sort of group. At the end of our time together, we hope you will leave us with your friendship.”</p> <p>He meant it. That gathering led to some of my closest friendships.</p> <p>But that night, this was all new to me. I was charged with a nervous energy about what was ahead. I had spent my life in the very flat part of Ohio. I had recently finished a factory-assisted build of a Glasair Sportsman and was fresh into a tail dragger endorsement.</p> <p>In other words, I was a menace.</p> <p>Looking out to the Bridger Mountains that evening, I thought to myself “don’t let anyone think you know anything and listen to those that do.”</p> <p>That’s how I came to know the RAF. I’ve been in that living room many times since and in lots of others too. At first I thought it was about grass strips and airplanes, but that’s just a point of entry.&nbsp;</p> <p>Generous friendship is the bond that makes the RAF work and is the source of its rewards. The only credential you need to be a good member is neighborliness. And you have to like orange.</p> <p>Is there another organization that gathers in homes all across the country? I’ve been welcomed into a dozen RAF member homes in the North West, the Mid West and the North East in the span of a few years.</p> <p>Is there another organization whose members welcome you as if you were the oldest of friends as they help push your airplane into their hangar or hand you the keys to their car?</p> <p>Is there another organization that takes you to the people and places that come to fill your photo files and memories?&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s easy to be sentimental about the RAF community.&nbsp; I’m sitting at a desk in Piqua, Ohio but my walls are covered with photos from places farther away.&nbsp; I see people in jeans and orange that have told me about their families, their favorite camping site, and where to get the best burger in Manhattan. Kansas, that is.&nbsp; I’ve gotten hours of training and advice from those with more skill.</p> <p>It was only later that I really got thinking about who these folks are outside of the RAF. They may have been camouflaged by RAF swag, but you probably passed the bread to an astronaut, or a mom who flies G650s, a combat pilot with a DFC, an airline CEO, a tech titan, a history teacher, a large-scale Pizza franchise operator and a guy that commanded the Thunderbirds.&nbsp; I’m sure you know what I mean about the talent in the RAF hiding its light under a bushel.</p> <p>I suspect all of us have had a similar experience coming into this membership. We have plenty to celebrate in our members and the energy they have for life. One of our younger members has racked time in more airplane models than anyone I know and earned his ASEL, AMEL and ASES by a week or so into his 17<sup>th</sup> year.&nbsp; The chat room with updates and videos of his epic journey had about forty people cheering him on like he was our godchild.</p> <p>As you get older, you tend to think about the people and activities that give meaning to your life. You think about the good fortune of family, friends and experiences with them. It’s humbling to be content.</p> <p>Thank you, RAF friends, for your company and wisdom. Thank you for your helping hands in all that we do as an organization. May we always leave the backcountry and our friends glad for our visits.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 38%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Joe&nbsp;is Chairman of Hartzell Propeller and involved in the General Aviation Manufacturers Association.

The meeting was facilitated by Scott Haas, Acting Dispersed Recreation Program Manager, and regularly District Ranger at Clear Creek, Colorado.&nbsp;</p> <p>The USFS representatives outlined the airstrip projects and challenges in their regions. A common concern was the desire for more comprehensive airstrip management plans. &#8220;Our partnership with the Forest Service is vital to the preservation of the more than seventy airstrips on Forest Service lands as their budgets continue to be pressured,” RAF President McGlynn said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to McGlynn, RAF meeting attendees were Oregon Liaisons Richard Mayes and Bill Ables, Idaho Liaison Bruce “Sparky” Parker, and Director of Marketing Kodi Myhre. RAF Director Tim Riley typically attends Forest Service planning meetings, but was previously committed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The group discussed the Challenge Cost Share Agreement, the intent of which is to collaborate with the RAF on airstrip maintenance, operations, and improvement projects. The Agreement&nbsp;outlines both the RAF and the USFS responsibilities and contributions to accomplish these projects.&nbsp;“We have developed mutual respect with leaders in the Forest Service because of our authentic desire to conserve these&nbsp;great aviation treasures.” McGlynn said.</p> <p>Specifically, projects reviewed were:</p> <p>Region 1 – 2022 work done at Moose Creek and Shearer airstrips. The RAF flew in an airport engineer (pro-bono) to collaborate with USFS on a runway rehabilitation plan. Work is expected to begin summer of 2023 and continue for two more years under a Master Cost Share Agreement with the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. A Montana Conservation Corps trail crew will begin work this June.&nbsp;The crew and equipment will be flown into Moose Creek with RAF resources.</p> <p>Region 3 – Sacaton, NM. Improvements are underway as part of the Cost Share Agreement between the RAF and the Gila National Forest. A work party is&nbsp;currently underway. Arizona’s Double Circle Ranch rehabilitation work was also reviewed.</p> <p>Region 4 – Airstrip grading on Idaho’s Indian Creek, Thomas Creek, Cabin Creek and Cold Meadows.&nbsp;There was discussion of 2023 irrigation and airstrip rehabilitation at Big Creek.</p> <p>Region 5 – Maintenance work at Gravelly Airstrip. Maintenance at Monache Meadows will occur in 2023, if accumulated snow levels allow.</p> <p>Region 6 – In 2022, the RAF provided a grant to the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative. This nonprofit group organized in 2016 at the request of Idaho’s Congressional Delegation to work with the USFS on user issues within the Hells Canyon National Recreation&nbsp;Area.</p> <p>Region 10 – Childs Glacier project. With grants from the USFS and Alaska Airmen&#8217;s Association, the RAF joined an Alaska trails crew and brushed out and lengthened the runway to make the airstrip usable. RAF provided a grant for the installation of aircraft tie-downs, an RAF windsock, and the purchase and seasonal storage of four bicycles for visitors to access the USFS campground one mile away. This summer, more airstrip work is expected to be completed.</p> <p>The RAF emphasized that the RAF is here to help the Forest Service and values its relationship. “They see that we are of the same cloth – trying to preserve our public lands that&nbsp;we all cherish,” McGlynn added.</p> <p><em>Submitted on April 14, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

In addition to initial efforts to widen the runway, the plan is to run millable timber through the vintage sawmill that has been reassembled on the Island. Milled planks will be used to construct a pilot shelter. “Frank knows of no project too small or too large,” Capozzi said. Everything must be barged or flown to the island from the mainland, and visitors marvel at the fire tower that Frank located, disassembled, barged to the island and reassembled there, including a massive amount of concrete for its base.</p> <p>Gary Davis cooked breakfasts for the crew of two dozen folks, including his son,&nbsp;RAF&nbsp;Georgia Ambassador Eric Davis, and&nbsp;RAF Georgia Ambassador Lou Furlong. Eric was&nbsp;dinner chef, including pork he’d cooked using&nbsp;Williams’&nbsp;Green Egg smoker for Saturday dinner, and as is typical, folks brought dishes to share.</p> <p>The palm trees are challenging, as they’re fibrous and collect sand. Williams keeps a saw sharpener on the island, and was very hopeful the crew could level a group of palms over the weekend. “The crew did it, and it was such a relief,” Capozzi said.</p> <p>Widening the runway is an ongoing project, and more work is planned for the April 14-16 weekend. “We ask everyone to bring a chainsaw and the food they need,” he added. “The last group brought chainsaws, saving a tremendous amount of time. Seemed they were happy to have a mission to use their new saws.”&nbsp;</p> <p>“Even though I’m from Florida they always make me feel very welcome here in Georgia,” Capozzi added. Eric and Gary Davis have overseen many project improvements to the island location. There are three bunkhouses, and the camping area includes flush toilets, showers, a picnic pavilion and fire ring. Pilots can use the solar-powered weather station and cameras for flight planning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Anyone desiring to fly-in during non-scheduled events MUST obtain permission from the owner 24-hours prior to arrival to obtain a runway report at 912-269-5194. No landings are authorized outside of scheduled events unless you have spoken with the owner. This is a safety requirement. Pilots must review the airport briefing before operating on this field in the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/d26c61ab-d1ca-4b67-b6be-3ea3d1a082fa/overview?searchQuery=creight">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on March 14, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is from Eric Hinson, the President and CEO of SimCom International</em>.</p> <p>For me, the Recreational Aviation Foundation exemplifies the power of collective action. Over the course of 20 years, through the efforts of an entirely voluntary workforce, the foundation has made a demonstrable impact on aviation infrastructure by preserving, restoring, and even creating new airports throughout the United States. We have all heard the origin story of the RAF, at least as it is told by John McKenna— a few pilots were huddled around a campfire in Montana contemplating the loss of backcountry and rural airports and decided something had to be done to reverse that trend. What those founders could not have contemplated was how much their message would resonate with other GA pilots and supporters. Today the RAF has thousands of members, all working toward a common goal of preserving aviation access everywhere. That is the power of the RAF—to borrow a phrase, E Pluribus Unum. </p> <p>The RAF is also about people connecting through common purpose. RAF members share a passion for aviation, adventure, and the great outdoors. We want to ensure backcountry accessibility for future generations, and we recognize that preserving remote airstrips and wilderness conservation are two sides of the same coin.&nbsp; I may be biased, but I believe RAF members are some of the most generous, caring, and humble people I know. They are passionate about the mission but without the histrionics and that’s what makes the organization so effective.&nbsp; So, here’s to the RAF’s next 20 years.&nbsp; May they be equally productive and filled with great friendship, camaraderie, and flying adventures!</p> <p><em>Eric Hinson is the President and CEO of SimCom International.</em></p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EHinson_Kodiak_Dec_21_35_1_65.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13649" width="304" height="228" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EHinson_Kodiak_Dec_21_35_1_65.jpg 917w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EHinson_Kodiak_Dec_21_35_1_65-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EHinson_Kodiak_Dec_21_35_1_65-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></figure> <p><em>Submitted on February 23, 2023</em>.</p> ]]>

We recognized it could become part of the great inventory of New Mexico’s accessible recreational airstrips,” Keller said, and they began the task to reopen it. The cooperative Challenge Cost Share agreement between the RAF and the Gila National Forest provided leverage for the project, and has been fulfilled to “return Sacaton airstrip to operational status to increase public access, promote tourism and economic development, while protecting the natural resource.”&nbsp;Keller adds, “As is the case for several other Gila airstrips, Sacaton is the result of a great team effort, including our partners in the Forest Service.”</p> <p>Pilots can now access this airstrip near Buckhorn, New Mexico. The runway lies along the Gila Wilderness with access to trails, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://trailsofenchantment.com/rain-creek-trail-trail-189/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rain Creek trail</a>. “The Wilderness offers fishing for the coveted Gila Trout,” Keller pointed out. Prior to landing, permission is required by calling USFS Gila Dispatch center at 800-538-1644. At its 6,200-ft elevation, pilots should be mindful of density altitude.

Many New Mexico Pilots Association volunteers helped over the three month period. On Veteran’s Day weekend, nine RAF and NMPA volunteers flew or drove in to work on the remote location in what Keller called “pretty austere conditions.” Work continued over Thanksgiving weekend, when Keller flew in to hoist the new windsock, and others arrived to help toss rocks and paint the runway end markers, and cut mesquite. “We are blessed to have dedicated volunteers from within New Mexico and nearby states that really do make the difference between wishing for a new airstrip and making it happen,” Keller said.</p> <p>Keller himself documented 100 hours between October and December, including the filing required by the FAA for charting, and the final task – listing Sacaton in the Airfield Guide.

On chart legends, the open magenta circle “R” was labeled Non-public use having emergency or landmark value. The FAA bulletin stated that “only private airports with landmark value will be retained and charted beyond February 23, 2023.” Naturally, there was concern that many airfields with “emergency” value could be dropped from charts.</p> <p>In 2020 the RAF, led by Wisconsin Director Jeff Russell, had launched an initiative to update private airfields to retain them on charts. RAF state liaisons contacted private airfield owners encouraging them to file updates with the FAA. “In cooperation with the FAA, we were able to update a lot of airfields,” Russell said. “This announcement caused us to reach out to the FAA for clarification so we wouldn’t lose any of these listings,” he added. AOPA was front and center in the dialogue, and as a result, the FAA clarified charting language. A January 12 AOPA news item by Jim Moore states, &#8220;The only difference is that the decision about whether to add or retain private airports will no longer consider their emergency use value.”</p> <p>On future chart legends, you’ll notice the term “emergency value” has been removed. The open magenta circle “R” now indicates a private, non-public use airfield, with “landmark value.”</p> <p>“Basically, this served to keep these airfields on the charts,” Russell said.<br>“We feel like the FAA acknowledged us, and accepted us as a partner, as they do AOPA.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on January 26, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is from Ben Sclair, Owner/Publisher of General Aviation News.</em></p> <p style="font-size:30px"><strong>20 Years of Todays</strong>.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the most effective way to ensure tomorrow is better than yesterday is to focus on the actions of today.</p> <p>And for 20 years, that is exactly what the Recreational Aviation Foundation has focused on.</p> <p>Today.</p> <p>It is that focus, on today, that provides a showcase for the value the RAF creates.</p> <p>There are a lot of todays in 20 years. More than 7,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>And in those 7,000 todays, the RAF, as I see it, has succeeded in two profound ways… building relationships and doing the work.</p> <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p> <p>At its core, the RAF is all about relationships. From the halls of D.C. to the neighbors of backcountry airstrips and everyone in between.</p> <p>Some of those todays have found RAF volunteers in Washington D.C. to cultivate long established relationships and create new ones.&nbsp;</p> <p>Closer to home, RAF members have poured countless hours into public meetings with people from numerous agencies, elected officials, state governments, departments of transportation, wildlife departments, state pilot groups, and more.</p> <p>These meetings attach a friendly and knowledgeable face to the organization.</p> <p>Looking beyond our government, the idea of building relationships is a driving force in the RAF swelling to more than “10,000 people who care deeply and do not want to stand by and watch these places [backcountry airstrips] go away.”</p> <p>Ten thousand people don’t just sign up to help because they’ll get a cool hat. Members of the RAF use today to give back. To make certain those precious backcountry airstrips are preserved for tomorrow&#8217;s aviators.</p> <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>DOING THE WORK</strong></p> <p>As important as meetings and relationships are, the RAF’s foundation is boots on ground that honor the commitments made in those countless meetings.</p> <p>It is a symbiotic relationship (there’s that word again).&nbsp;</p> <p>The commitments that come from the meetings are carried out by the work of 10,000+ RAF members. And that work makes it easier, but not easy, to maintain vital relationships that allow the RAF to commit to preserving a way of life.</p> <p>“The RAF is dedicated to preserving existing airstrips and creating new public-use recreational airstrips throughout the United States.”</p> <p>That purpose is the backbone of the RAF and makes its value beyond measure.</p> <p>And what work did 10,000+ RAF members do with 20 years of todays that will ensure tomorrow is better than yesterday? An incomplete list in no particular order includes…</p> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li>pick up and use hand tools</li> <li>build shelters</li> <li>dig trenches</li> <li>chop wood</li> <li>set and clean outhouses (RAF commits to spending more than $500 per month to pump out those outhouses.)</li> <li>pull weeds</li> <li>contribute to public policy committee work</li> <li>mow grass</li> <li>plan and cook work party meals</li> <li>trim brush</li> <li>write and mail handwritten thank you notes</li> <li>build fences</li> <li>create noise mitigation plans</li> <li>build picnic tables</li> <li>attend and report on public policy meetings</li> <li>donate bicycles</li> <li>build and maintain camping areas</li> <li>host fly-ins</li> <li>exhibit at fly-ins</li> <li>take pictures</li> <li>make videos</li> <li>build an online <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp">airfield guide</a></li> <li>and share the love that is recreational aviation.</li> </ul> <p>The RAF is more than this limited list. Much more.</p> <p>I believe the definition of “leave it better than you found it” should simply point to the RAF.</p> <p>The efforts of RAF members is oftentimes unglamorous.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the satisfaction from seeing dirt under fingernails at day&#8217;s end results in a satisfying sigh and perhaps a well-earned beverage or two among friends.</p> <p>It is a willingness to do the unglamorous work today that will ensure every tomorrow will be better than yesterday.</p> <p>Bravo RAF. Here’s to the next 20 years of todays.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 55%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p><em>Ben Sclair is the owner/publisher of General Aviation News.</em></p> </div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="496" height="217" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-26-145754ben.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13517 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-26-145754ben.jpg 496w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot-2023-01-26-145754ben-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted on January 26, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

So far, work has been completed at Del Norte airstrip, in the Devils River State Natural Area.</p> <p>“The main focus now is West Texas,” Clinton said. “We have been working with Asa Vermeulen, Devils River State Natural Area Complex Superintendent, and Adam Jarrett, West Texas State Parks Regional Director, who have direct control over the specific target areas,” Clinton said.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Del-Norte-Group-Edit.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13601" width="438" height="232" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Del-Norte-Group-Edit.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Del-Norte-Group-Edit-300x160.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Del-Norte-Group-Edit-768x409.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>From left to right:&nbsp;John Cyrier, Tres Clinton, Beau Hester (Park Superintendent of Devils River SNA Del Norte Unit) and Asa Vermeulen</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Former Texas State Representative John Cyrier has been instrumental in advocating for recreational airstrips on Park lands, and he and Clinton flew out to Del Norte to check out the recent work. This neglected strip became unlandable last spring due to trees and cactus growth. “Asa Vermeulen gets the credit for all of the work to turn this into a useable 1,600-ft strip,” Clinton said. “Our purpose was to check out the work accomplished, the condition of the strip, decide parking and camping areas, to deliver a windsock and frame, and mostly to say ‘thank you’ for all of their hard work,” he said. A few trees will be cleared for the parking area, and Vermeulen is looking into natural or seeded ground cover options to retain its status as a Natural area. “Currently they do not allow fires but we are negotiating this as well, Clinton added.</p> <p>“Our immediate goals with Del Norte are to finish clearing the camping areas, finalize rules, get the windsock up, update information with the FAA and Foreflight, and list in the Airfield Guide, and get a state-funded composting toilet, and plan a grand opening,” Clinton said.</p> <p>The other airstrip within the Devil’s River Natural Area is Dan Allen Hughes with a hike to river access. Dan Allen is about 3,800 feet and paved. “The two strips are about an hour and-a-half drive, and literally a six minute Cub flight from each other.” Clinton said. “Del Norte is more scenic with some amazing overlooks.” Dan Allen is undergoing about $15 million in Parks improvements, including a common area with showers and restrooms walking distance from the airstrip. Clinton is exploring specific improvements and delivered a windsock and frame.&nbsp;“I&#8217;m excited about the progress.” Clinton said. “The future looks good.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on February 10, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

This month&#8217;s guest editorial is from Mark Baker, President&nbsp;of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.</em><br></p> <p>There are many thousands of pilots in this great country, flying millions of miles each year to many thousands of great destinations — near and far, big and small, paved and rocky. And, still, we treasure the fact that we’re a close-knit community. When we meet up with fellow aviators, we’re all among friends.</p> <p>The general aviation community has a shared interest in not only pursuing this great passion we have for flight, but protecting it and, together, ensuring that our freedom to fly is never threatened and remains open. We are more powerful when we come and stand together as partners.</p> <p>Partnership is a key word for AOPA. Not only do we appreciate our members, who allow us to do what we do, but we treasure the relationships we have with a variety of organizations — all under the banner of promoting and protecting general aviation. Whether it’s our business partners and advertisers, fellow general aviation organizations, type clubs, and those with a special mission — like the Recreational Aviation Foundation — we stand strong as one.</p> <p>Our special relationship with the RAF is a prime example of how two like-minded organizations come together to protect this shared passion. We’re like-minded about access, passionate about safety and diligent in ensuring that generations to come are able to experience the exhilaration and freedom of being above it all. We bring different experiences and skills to the table, but they all meld as one when safeguarding general aviation.</p> <p>While formally founded 20 years ago, I know the mission of the RAF — to preserve, improve, and create airstrips for recreational access — is something that dates back to the early days of aviation, in the true spirit of adventure and discovery. The RAF is an extremely important player in making sure we can continue to explore through the air.</p> <p>The RAF was one of the first groups with which I forged a bond when I became the head of AOPA nearly a decade ago. I still remember that special Southwest fly-around when I saw first-hand the passion and camaraderie of the RAF. I have always had a special place in my heart for backcountry flying to remote locations, having taken a variety of airplanes from one side of this nation to the other — to the Rocky Mountains, Alaska, the Florida Keys, Pacific Northwest, Northern Wisconsin, and so many points in-between. I’m sure that many of you reading this have seen me with my revered Super Cub in one of the special places in which the RAF focuses its work.</p> <p>The RAF quickly showed me that it was the leading voice and force in keeping access to all of these special places, and more, open to all of us. Not all of us across the country understand and appreciate what general aviation brings to our local communities, in terms of economic impact, jobs, and the ability to pursue something uniquely American. The RAF has stood tall and firm, ensuring we have access to so many airstrips in many special locations.</p> <p>Simply stated, the RAF gets things done. And done well.</p> <p>I became fast friends with a group of important folks at the RAF, such as John McKenna, Bill McGlynn, Tim Clifford, and many others. Since then, the RAF has become an important partner — to both myself as an aviator and to AOPA. There are so many special people at the RAF, its leaders and all of the volunteers I see at events and amazing locations. I know when I see those orange shirts, that I, and all of general aviation, is in very capable hands.</p> <p>Great partnerships happen when people and organizations are aligned in their values and mission. While many of us consider our flying to be play, there is a lot of work that goes on to protect this play. The RAF truly defines the mantra of work hard, play hard.&nbsp;</p> <p>I look forward to seeing many orange shirts in 2023 and in the years to come.</p> <p><em>Mark Baker is the President of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. </em></p> <figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mark-Baker-1024x839.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13276" width="290" height="238" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mark-Baker-1024x839.jpeg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mark-Baker-300x246.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mark-Baker-768x629.jpeg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mark-Baker-1536x1259.jpeg 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mark-Baker.jpeg 1552w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></figure> <p><em>Submitted on December 28, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

It was that experience that convinced me that I wanted to learn to fly,”&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;says.</p> <p>He started training at Seattle’s Boeing Field in 1965, the same year he began his career in the budding cable tv industry. The following year he participated in a new franchise build in the San Francisco area, where he earned his PPL in a C182 he’d bought with a partner for training. “We flew it to Seattle the day after I was signed off. It was clear from the get-go that a plane offered more than recreation – it was a means of getting somewhere,” he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1967 he and a partner went independent and expanded in other communities in the Sacramento valley and in the Sierras north of Reno. “The 182 was now a trusted steed that was moving us easily between the systems,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Expanding beyond California, they pursued the purchase of a system in Coeur d’Alene, ID, requiring&nbsp;Gordon’s presence at a city council meeting. The 182 was not available, and a strike had shut down commercial service into Spokane. There was a B55 Baron for sale at Antioch, and, “I bought it on the spot, received a checkride, and flew from Antioch to Coeur d’Alene, arriving in time for the meeting,”&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;says. “It was clear that we had a competitive advantage, not needing to depend on commercial air service.” All their service areas had small GA airports, and all but one of&nbsp;Gordon’s seven partners were pilots. “The Baby Baron I bought without much thought ended up being a great fit, flying for two decades of relatively trouble-free service,”&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;says. As the enterprise grew into Alaska, the need for larger and faster planes followed.</p> <p>“Our love of flying and our need to travel were working in harmony,” he points out, and they enjoyed plenty of recreation. Their Colorado locations served areas with five ski resorts. A favorite recreational flying experience was airplane camping in Canada and Alaska, what&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;calls “adventure flying.” He says, “Backcountry is where, adventure is why.”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gordon-Rock-Jack-Pelton-Pete-Bunce-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13430" width="380" height="253" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gordon-Rock-Jack-Pelton-Pete-Bunce-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gordon-Rock-Jack-Pelton-Pete-Bunce-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gordon-Rock-Jack-Pelton-Pete-Bunce-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>From left to right: Gordon Rock,&nbsp;RAF Director Pete Bunce, and&nbsp;EAA CEO and Chairman of the Board Jack Pelton at Oshkosh AirVenture in 2022.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>One adventure as a result of flying in the Yukon occurred in 1973.&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;learned of the WWII era Canol Road, built to get oil from Norman Wells – about 80 miles south of the Arctic Circle – up and over the Continental Divide to a refinery in Whitehorse, YK.&nbsp;</p> <p>The road had washed out in 1945 and was abandoned.&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;and six fellows succeeded in making the 366 mile journey on Honda ATCs with balloon tires – the first motorized crossing of the Canol Road since its closure in 1945. “The logistics required stashes of fuel, food, and parts along the primitive route, and we used the 182 to manage some very off-field landings to accomplish that mission.” They staged a second plane, a twin C320, at the end of the ride to facilitate logistics. “Couldn’t have done it without the air support for staging and transportation from California and back,”&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;pointed out.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GordonRock-work-party.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13429" width="378" height="378" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GordonRock-work-party.jpeg 960w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GordonRock-work-party-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GordonRock-work-party-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GordonRock-work-party-768x768.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>RAF and UBCP volunteers Wayne Loeber, Carmine Mowbray, John Priscu, John Morton and Gordon Rock&nbsp;welcome users to a new composting toilet at Mackie Ranch in Utah.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>In 1979&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;and his brother bought a 206 on floats. “I have been flying it now for over 43 years. It provides the family with wonderful access to our remote cabin in Canada. Now, our third generation rates the cabin as their favorite place to be,” he adds.</p> <p>Gordon&nbsp;lost his younger brother and a partner in a 206 accident between Libby, MT and Coeur d’ Alene, ID in 1980. “The loss was devastating and one that you never fully recover from,” he says. Afterward, Gordon and his business partners began selling systems, and the Alaska systems were the last to go in the late 90s.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gordon&nbsp;continues traveling with IFR capable planes. He also enjoys “life in the low and slow category” with his floatplane, Highlander and Kitfox Lite. Skilled in building complex projects,&nbsp;Gordon, with assistance built a Glastar, Zodiac 501 and his Highlander.&nbsp;</p> <p>His introduction to the emerging RAF was with an original director, Karl Spielman on a backcountry access issue on BLM land in Utah. It lead to an introduction to John and Tricia McKenna. “My sense was that these people had passion and an important mission. Recreational access was being challenged, and I was impressed and eager to be a supporter. Ryan Field was just starting to come together and the young RAF was gaining momentum,” he says.</p> <p>“Any successful venture is largely the result of motivated and passionate people. At its core the RAF was attracting supporters who were eager to pitch in. That the RAF has accomplished so much, is a tribute to its volunteers,”&nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;said, adding, “As the RAF has become larger and more respected and successful, it has retained its culture, focusing on results, not who gets credit; with humility and appreciation of others. Being trustworthy, and doing more than its share. This motivates and inspires others.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on January 11, 2023.</em></p> ]]>

He hid away his dream of flying for decades. “One day I walked into a fly-in breakfast in Monticello, Iowa and discovered how cheap one could buy a secondhand kit plane.” He purchased a Titan Tornado for about the same price as a good used car. When he was ready for his light-sport checkride, the 2-cycle Rotax engine needed a rebuild. Not deterred, Ken took some lessons in a Cessna 172&nbsp;and went ahead to receive his PPL.</p> <p>Due to his love of the outdoors Ken was drawn to recreational and backcountry flying from the beginning. He found the RAF about 2018 and was quickly recruited to be an RAF Ambassador. Ken still has the Titan Tornado, “but it doesn’t get much use since I bought a 1961 Piper Colt with a tailwheel conversion in 2021,” he says. He is also rebuilding a damaged Maule M5-235C. “In 2023, I’ll be on the fourth year of this two year project,” he muses.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ken&#8217;s main focus in aviation is having fun, and encouraging other pilots to remain active. Shortly after he passed his checkride, he committed to a social presence with the East Iowa Aviator Facebook Group with the goal to get other pilots and students on flyouts together. “It has been successful at keeping the fun in flying, and has even brought several rusty pilots back to the hobby they once enjoyed,” he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ken&#8217;s other hobbies include fishing, hunting, hiking, canoeing and he has been a ham radio operator for over 30 years with the callsign AD4OS. He loves to combine these hobbies with flying whenever he can.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the RAF, Ken also volunteers time with AOPA and EAA. Ken can be reached at <a href="mailto:kwarren@theraf.org">kwarren@theraf.org</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on December 29, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

RAF supporter Randy Roth brought his front end loader and moved hundreds of basketball- and larger-size rocks that had made the “X” in the middle of the runway. He repurposed them around the segmented circle. Roth attached this heavy auger and drilled the holes for the windsock pole. Using the rear blade, he carved out the new runway and removed small trees. “What a huge help,” Keller said, “And he was always the first one working every morning.”</p> <p>Keller conducted additional work the week of October 31.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sporting-RAF-work-party-hats-resized.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13120" width="359" height="268" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sporting-RAF-work-party-hats-resized.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sporting-RAF-work-party-hats-resized-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sporting-RAF-work-party-hats-resized-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></figure></div> <p>During the Veteran’s Day weekend, nine RAF and New Mexico Pilots Association volunteers flew or drove in to work on the remote location, 10 miles north of Buckhorn, NM. “We had pretty austere conditions,” Keller said. Volunteers tackled the two- to three-foot high wheatgrass, “that acted like a teflon coating over the ground, but eventually we were able to scrape out the runway, with volunteers tossing hundreds of rocks and helping to cut or pull out small trees and vegetation,” Keller said. A punctured tractor tire required loading the tractor so Roth could haul it back for tire replacement two hours away, returning the next day.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sacaton-Landing-Strip-overhead-cropped.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13127" width="367" height="255" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sacaton-Landing-Strip-overhead-cropped.jpg 621w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sacaton-Landing-Strip-overhead-cropped-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" /></figure></div> <p>On Thanksgiving weekend, Keller flew in to hoist the new windsock, and three others in two planes helped toss rocks, and painted the runway end markers and cut more mesquite.</p> <p>Keller prepared charting documentation for the Gila Forest Aviation Officer, who has submitted it to the FAA. An airspace study is underway, required for approval for the FAA location identification. “I hope we get approval for general use by New Years,” Keller said.</p> <p>Sacaton lies at 6,200-ft elevation, so pilots should be mindful of density altitude.

I&#8217;ve had a number of different propellers on my 185, and the Voyager has outperformed them in all quadrants. Not to mention, it’s a great looking propeller,” McKenna added.</p> <p>See&nbsp;<a href="https://hartzellaviation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://hartzellaviation.com</a>.</p> <p><em>Posted December 14, 2022</em></p> ]]>

They have proven to be a multi-skilled “dynamic duo” when it comes to upkeep and upgrades.</p> <p>They installed a second new tankless water heater, so both showers have dedicated hot water. Thanks to the water pressure boost pump Eric installed last year,&nbsp;“we finally have good water pressure so both showers can be used at the same time,” he said.&nbsp;With no electricity on the island, he noted that the Honda generator must be running in order for the boost pump to operate,&nbsp;and the shower lights to burn. They also repaired the PVC water supply lines that feed the middle cabin, restoring water service to that location.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_113201-1-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13250" width="635" height="847" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_113201-1-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_113201-1-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_113201-1-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></figure></div> <p>Gary spent time on the tractor mowing the runway, then using the box blade implement, he leveled some high spots, and they smoothed out dips caused by animals digging.&nbsp;Gary also mowed the area between the pavilion and the shoreline, where volunteers had cleared underbrush and installed an RAF fire ring during a previous work party.</p> <p>Eric completed battery maintenance&nbsp;on the 100-ft high fire-watch tower where he’d previously installed the island&#8217;s line-of-sight wireless&nbsp;radios. He explains that Island owner Frank Williams had purchased the tower from the Forest Service, then barged the parts to the Island and rebuilt it with help from friends, years&nbsp;before Creighton Island was known to the&nbsp;RAF.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The views from the tower are amazing and it&#8217;s a great&nbsp;place to enjoy the sunrise or sunset,” Eric says. “It was the&nbsp;perfect place for me to install the radios, providing an unobstructed view to the mainland where we connect to the Internet. From this tower, I redistribute&nbsp;the signal wirelessly to several structures on the island as well as the windsock&nbsp;tower, where the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNRmOSzakItdbaHKSZChrw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runway cameras</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tempestwx.com/station/14385/grid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weather station</a>&nbsp;are installed.” The solar-powered system provides WiFi internet service to island&nbsp;visitors as well as keeping the runway camera and weather station feeds online. “I am pleased that it&#8217;s been in near-continuous operation since 2019, powered only by the sun,” he added.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_140515-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13251" width="-183" height="-244" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_140515-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_140515-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221029_140515.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div> <p>The batteries ensure the system stays online overnight and during extended periods of cloud coverage. Users may have noted some recent intermittence. If the battery voltage drops below a safe level, the&nbsp;runway system shuts down until the solar panels can recharge the&nbsp;batteries the following day.&nbsp;The batteries on the windsock tower need to be replaced due to age, combined with shorter seasonal daylight. Eric plans to replace them in December.</p> <p>The RAF thanks Eric and Gary for their skills and dedication to improving Creighton Island for all to enjoy. The pair have devoted hundreds of hours, substantial materials and travel expense.</p> <p>“Fortunately there&#8217;s not much needed in the way of maintenance except to clean the solar panels and replace the batteries every couple of years,” Eric says. “As an RAF supporter and ambassador, I’ve done this in the spirit of the RAF&#8217;s mission and as far as most are concerned, these improvements were made by the RAF,” he adds.</p> <p><em>Submitted on December 14, 2022</em></p> ]]>

Rather than be drafted and sent to Vietnam, Bob applied for pilot training in his hometown of Syracuse Air National Guard unit and was selected for a year of active duty at Laughlin AFB in Texas for Undergraduate Pilot Training.&nbsp;</p> <p>His love of airplanes started at the kitchen table building model planes with his dad who’d named him after Bob’s uncle Robert who was a pilot. Bob excelled in UPT, returned to Syracuse, leading to a 28 year career as a flight instructor in the 174<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Tac Fighter Wing, flying the F-86H, A-10, and finally the F-16 Fighting Falcon. “It was like replacing an old Plymouth sedan with a Porsche,” he says. “It was the hottest fighter in the world in its time.” As a combat ready fighter pilot, Operation Desert Storm put him in the skies over Iraq and Kuwait for six months. After overseas duty, Bob was reassigned to his hometown fighter unit. “For our outstanding performance in combat, our unit was rewarded with an upgrade to the F-16C,” he recalls. “After beating up my body for another five years in a 9-g fighter, I realized this was a young man’s game,” he said, and retired as a full Colonel.</p> <p>Returning to civilian life, Bob joined a flying club and starting flying charter in a BE-90. After passing flight aptitude, physical and psych evals, Delta Airlines hired him as Flight Engineer and First Officer on the B-727, MD-88 and B-767/400.</p> <p>In 2015 Bob chased another dream and bought a house in the Adirondacks in northern New York, close to the town of Keene. He became interested in Marcy Field, a beautiful 2,200 foot turf airfield near Mount Marcy, the Adirondack’s highest peak. On the field is a plaque dedicating the airfield to Dr. Goff, a legend in the area for flying off the field to tend folks. Bob offered to help manage the airport for the chance to keep his airplane in a hangar, and he became the assistant Airport Manager, a position he still loves to fulfill. </p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/952-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13222" width="453" height="340" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/952-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/952-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/952-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/952-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></figure></div> <p>He now flies his 1949 Piper Clipper with the O-320 engine. While flying scenic tours at the Lake Placid Airport, (“flying is a lot more fun when someone else is paying for the gas,”) Bob began tending to Marcy Field in earnest. Teaching Low Level Awareness Training in the Guard prepared him for mountain flying and made him aware of terrain hazards, like the poplars that had grown high into the approach end of runway 20. Lake Placid pilots told him about the RAF, and New York Liaison Doug Turnbull helped Bob obtain grant money to cut and remove the tall trees. Bob enlisted help from the Adirondack Flying Group, the town road crew, and Town Supervisor Joe Pete Wilson came personally to help remove brush.</p> <p>When you see Marcy Field, 1I1 now, it’s a park-like opening along Rte. 73 and the east branch of the Ausable River. There’s a running track, and a town building used for community gatherings. Between May and October, it’s the sight of a very popular farmers market. “This caused a few go-arounds, even though the nice people below would look up from their picnic and wave at us pilots,” Bob explained. “But I realized it was a hazard both to pilots, and folks on the ground.”</p> <p>Again with the help of the Town of Keene and Supervisor Wilson, “We put our heads together and made a plan,” Bob says. He acquired another RAF grant to cover design, fabrication, and hardware for a set of signs to prevent incursions, completing another safety enhancement at Marcy Field.</p> <p>Bob’s efforts really show the spirit of the RAF. Using a few grant dollars, he motivated volunteers, and leveraged his resources into making Marcy Field a very desirable airfield. “Another key was demonstrating to the Town and its Board the value of retaining Marcy Field as a viable recreational destination,” he added. “I’ve had people tell me how much they love Marcy Field and its history, ‘because Dr. Goff delivered me as a baby, and brought a deer he’d shot to help feed us!’”</p> <p><em>Submitted on December 14, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

But when he flew me to that breakfast, I decided I wanted to learn to fly,” he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kevin began flying in the Portland, Oregon area when he could rent a “wet” Cessna 150 for about three bucks an hour. In spite of the area’s legendary rains, he attained his private, instrument, and commercial licenses, and eventually flew commercially for a corporate entity in Houston, where he met Melinda. They’ve been married for 37 years and have two grown sons. The elder is an associate professor of pharmacy in Little Rock, AR with two young children; and their younger son is in the construction business.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kevin-Johnson.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13003" width="299" height="398" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kevin-Johnson.jpg 751w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kevin-Johnson-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></figure></div> <p>Now living in Gladstone Oregon a dozen miles south of Portland, Kevin helps his son in the family construction business, and manages their commercial and residential rental properties. Melinda is enjoying retirement.</p> <p>“In 1976 my dad and I bought a 1969 Cessna 172. We still own it. My son now owns my dad’s half,” he says. Kevin’s younger son earned his license while he was still in college, then got married. His wife earned her license a couple of years later. They have a child, so, “There might be a fourth generation of pilots in our family,” Kevin muses. The tot’s name is Jett, and Kevin’s “grand dog” is named Piper. “We like aviation stuff,” Kevin adds.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Work-Party-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13004" width="374" height="281" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Work-Party-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Work-Party-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Work-Party-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ryan-Work-Party.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></figure></div> <p>In addition to membership in AOPA and the Oregon Pilots Association, Kevin supports EAA and in 2016 he attended an RAF mountain flying seminar at AirVenture, and was motivated to become an RAF supporter. But that didn’t just mean signing up and sending a check. Kevin has volunteered at Oregon’s McKenzie Bridge work parties where he met RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes. He has twice flown his C172, and twice driven to Ryan Field to work on the barn and cabins.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kevin’s skills are in demand, and he has contributed a lot of gratis construction work locally, as well. He helped build a press box and storage building for Gladstone high school, where he and both his sons attended. Referring to his time on RAF projects, he says, “I’ve done a lot of volunteer work, but this has been the most fun, and the best people.”</p> <p>He has watched the RAF gain attention and involve more people from all over the country, and their many hours of volunteer effort. “I’ve only worked a few weekends,” he says, adding, “People can see the stuff I do, but everything that people do that’s not visible is more important.”&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on November 11, 2022.</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

The ribbon was cut by key volunteers Steve and Nancy Sappington from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blueskycenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Sky Center</a>,&nbsp;who helped drive the project. Alex Guerrero, the craftsman of Warrior Wagons built a new welcome and information sign, installed on the ramp to greet pilots.</p> <p>“Donors, supporters, and fans of the airstrip were there, with four planes lined up at the new parking area,” RAF California Liaison Katerina Barilov said. Dinner for donors and key supporters followed at the Buckhorn resort.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/runway-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12937" width="478" height="637" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/runway-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/runway-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/runway.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></figure></div> <p>The airport surface had deteriorated and was closed in 2019. A small group of pilots formed a relationship with the Blue Sky Center who offered free housing to volunteers. A donor contributed $400,000 toward re-paving, and thanks to additional funds raised directly from the public, the 3,380-ft runway and tie-down areas have been repaved and marked. </p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="618" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sEm-Speech-1a-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12938" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sEm-Speech-1a-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sEm-Speech-1a-1-300x185.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sEm-Speech-1a-1-768x475.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <p>Barilov applied for an RAF grant and coordinated tasks with the Blue Sky Center. A&nbsp;new fly-in campground is planned nearby. The RAF grant provided supplies for the construction of eight tent platforms in space that will accommodate airplane parking next to each platform.&nbsp;A work party is scheduled December 10 to begin developing the fly-in campground. Volunteers will be asked to assemble and arrange the new tent platforms and fire rings. Future work parties are anticipated to complete and beautify the campground.&nbsp;Anyone interested in volunteering should contact Barilov at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kbarilov@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kbarilov@theraf.org</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 30, 2022</em></p> ]]>

After meetings with aviation advocates, and a public comment period in which the Park Service received many comments in support of retaining the facility, imminent closure has been averted. “The aviation community&nbsp;including the RAF, AOPA and California Pilots Association have a good relationship with the Park Service leadership, beginning years ago with RAF California Liaison Rich Lach,” Riley said. The parties agreed on short- and long-term plans to preserve the airport. Most likely, the asphalt surface will eventually be converted to gravel, “which largely eliminates problems with heaving asphalt in Death Valley’s heat,” Riley said, adding, &#8220;RAF key volunteer and NEPA expert, Roger Blew, was instrumental in guiding the conversation and proposing viable alternatives throughout the process.&#8221;<br><br>The airport was first developed in 1948 at the site of the current campground. In the early to mid-1970s&nbsp;the Park Service&nbsp;moved&nbsp;the airstrip&nbsp;to its present location and paved it. The airstrip is within a short walk to tourist services. Part of the Park’s concern was low visitation, but public comments made a strong case that only a fraction of users sign in.&nbsp;<br><br>The Park’s “Findings of No Significant Impact&#8221; document in part states, “Overall, the selected alternative will be beneficial to visitor use and experience and would allow continued recreational use of the Stovepipe Wells Developed Area.” Additional benefits are explained: “Converting the asphalt airstrip to gravel will restore a large area of permeable surface within the floodplain.”<br><br>The RAF reminds pilots to always sign in to signify usage; and be aware of the effects of noise near settlements at both Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek, which lies near the Native Timbisha Village.</p> <p><em>Submitted on November 14, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

In addition, the agreement acknowledges mutual desire to return Sacaton airstrip to operational status to increase public access, promote tourism and economic development, while protecting the natural resource. RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller points out that the New Mexico Airstrip Network (NMAN) wrote the Gila Airstrips Integrated Operations and Maintenance Plan that the Forest Service used to enhance justification for this&nbsp;agreement. The RAF and New Mexico Pilots Association are two of the 13 partners that comprise the NMAN. Keller speaks for the NMAN, saying, “I believe that proven results over 10 years and the ability to build trust with the Forest Service enabled the completion of this Challenge Cost Share.</p> <p>RAF President Bill McGlynn said, &#8220;Ron Keller has been tireless in his efforts to take care of the Gila Forest airstrips and I believe that is recognized by the signing of this agreement and the support of the staff in the Gila National Forest.&#8221;</p> <p>The Agreement states in part:</p> <p>Both parties have common interests including increasing recreational access to federal lands, maintaining existing airstrips for recreational access, promoting responsible outdoor recreation use of federal lands and waters, continue to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nations’ forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.</p> <p>The Agreement outlines objectives for safe operation and maintenance, desired airstrip conditions, survey and inspections, and maintenance guidelines for each of the Gila Forest airstrips.</p> <p>Regarding the viability and legitimacy of airstrips on our National Forests, the Agreement reiterates messages the RAF and other backcountry aviators have long advocated:</p> <p>• Airstrips are an important part of recreational infrastructure on Forest Service lands.</p> <p>• Use of these airstrips for recreational access is a legitimate use.</p> <p>• Airstrips provide low impact method of access to various recreation sites.</p> <p>• Certain airstrips are important from both a historical and cultural aspects of an area.</p> <p>• Airstrips provide potential access for emergency services, firefighting efforts, and administrative efforts.</p> <p>&nbsp; “This agreement took years of patience on Ron&#8217;s part but it is now coming to fruition with the preservation of the five named airstrips, and the reopening of a long-closed airstrip. A heart-felt thank you to all those involved and especially to Ron for leading the way, “ McGlynn added.</p> <p><em>Submitted October 13, 2022</em></p> ]]>

Privately owned by <a href="https://www.blueskycenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Blue Sky Center</a>, a nonprofit community development organization that promotes an “offbeat but comfortable camping, retreat, or event experience,” it is open for public use. Built by Atlantic Richfield Company in 1950, more recently it has served as a popular out-of-the-way destination for Southern California pilots, students seeking cross-country hours, and emergency services such as air ambulance and fighting wildfire.</p> <p>But years of hot sun had taken their toll on the asphalt, and in 2019, the deteriorating runway was closed. A small group of pilots determined to re-open the airport formed a relationship with the Blue Sky Center who offered free housing to volunteers. The group contacted a donor willing to contribute $400,000 toward re-paving, and thanks to additional funds raised directly from the public, the 3,940-ft runway and tie-down areas could be repaved and marked. The work began in 2020 and is currently underway with a grand re-opening and ribbon cutting scheduled for October 13.</p> <p>RAF California Liaison Katerina Barilov applied successfully for an RAF grant to enhance camping amenities by adding tent platforms, shade structures, fire pits, signage, and a kiosk. The Blue Sky Center also offered $2,000 toward campground improvement. In addition to Blue Sky volunteers, Barilov said, “We will rally local volunteers from the pilot community to do a large portion of the work required.” She hopes to have the work completed by grand re-opening day.</p> <p>The facility offers expansive views of the New Cuyama valley, access to hiking trails to nearby Corizo Plain National Monument and Los Padres National Forest. Barilov points out that New Cuyama is a rural community of 1,100 residents, including many artists and food entrepreneurs. There is a restaurant in the recently renovated Cuyama Buckhorn hotel, two blocks from the runway. In addition to event facilities, the Blue Sky Center airport campus features glamping huts, and galleries of local art and studio spaces open for use by pilot visitors.&nbsp;</p> <p>“New Cuyama offers the only full-service public campground for pilots to experience the Southern California desert environment while enjoying the amenities of a full-time host, water, restrooms, showers, and restaurants and artisans within walking distance,” Barilov said.&nbsp;</p> <p>When reopened, watch for its listing to appear in the Airfield Guide.</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 30, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

The agreement acknowledges “mutual desire to return Sacaton airstrip to operational status to increase public access, promote tourism and economic development, while protecting the natural resource.”&nbsp;</p> <p>This agreement is the outcome&nbsp;RAF New Mexico Liaison Keller was hoping for. He recounted, &#8220;At least a decade ago, folks met at Sacaton airstrip, including RAF Ambassador Larry Filener and RAF Arizona Liaison Mark Spencer. Even though it had been dormant for over thirty years, we recognized it could become part of the great inventory of New Mexico’s accessible recreational airstrips.” The airstrip is adjacent to the Rain Creek Trailhead into the Gila Wilderness, America’s first federally designated wilderness. &#8220;The Wilderness offers fishing for the coveted Gila Trout,” Keller said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In May 2021, Keller and RAF supporters John Lorenz and Chris Wilson met with the USFS at the Glenwood Ranger Office to discuss various airstrip projects. Then Keller made a presentation about airports’ economic and tourism potential to a receptive Catron County Commission.&nbsp;</p> <p>“This agreement is a great example of the collaboration that we have strived to achieve and a door opener for the other 153 National Forests in the system,” RAF President Bill McGlynn said. “It’s significant because it includes the reconditioning of a formerly closed airstrip on the Gila National Forest.&nbsp;Kudos to Ron and the New Mexico pilots for their patience and persistence to make this&nbsp;happen.”</p> <p>New Mexico Pilots Association will support the effort by providing a custom-built leveling drag that was used during the Rainy Mesa rehabilitation, and by providing a windsock pole. Keller says there are plans for a vault toilet and picnic tables near the trailhead. “Of course, volunteers from both organizations, many dual members, will be contributing sweat equity for the project,” he added.</p> <p>The first Sacaton work party is scheduled for October 24-26. The plan is to lay out the runway footprint and clear the first 2,000 feet, and install the windsock pole. Future work will be scheduled as weather permits at the 6,100-ft elevation. In the meantime Sacaton remains closed.</p> <p><em>Submitted October 14, 2022</em></p> ]]>

Ten volunteers including Supporter Brian Thomas and CT Ambassador Greg Delp showed up to improve the camping area near the two turf runways, the longest of which is 2,000 feet long. “A group of airport tenants and supporters cut and split the majority of the firewood a couple days before this event to help us out,” Lyons said.</p> <p>The airport provided an excavator at no charge so the volunteers could remove a stump. “We did some general clean up, trimmed brush, cleared poison ivy from the firewood stacks and fire ring areas,” Lyons said. “We cut in a new path from the tent platforms up to the flight line, and cut in stairs.” They replaced an old stone-lined fire ring with retaining wall blocks.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="749" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/63432BF3-9D81-45B4-8DAB-CEE6E52F2A1D-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12833" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/63432BF3-9D81-45B4-8DAB-CEE6E52F2A1D-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/63432BF3-9D81-45B4-8DAB-CEE6E52F2A1D-1-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/63432BF3-9D81-45B4-8DAB-CEE6E52F2A1D-1-1-768x575.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <p>Lyons and other RAF volunteers had improved the camping at this pastoral field in 2021 by building tent platforms and adding a fire ring. Waterbury is only about 80 miles from New York City, and offers a backcountry contrast to the bustle of the city.

More than 40 RAF volunteers were brought up-to-date on current efforts of AOPA Regional Managers, and engaged in collaborative discussions about issues critical to both organizations.</p> <p>AOPA’s Mike Ginter, VP of Airports and State Advocacy, introduced each Regional Manager, stating their purpose as year-round advocates for airports and General Aviation. “We are special interest lobbyists for general aviation and we love it,” Ginter said. Each manager is tasked with staying vigilant on relevant issues. They heartily invite RAF liaisons to bring issues to their attention, and as registered lobbyists, they have the credentials to influence legislators. They have successfully blocked detrimental aircraft fees and taxes, and bolstered state funding programs for GA airports. They’ve educated legislators on industry progress toward cleaner avgas, and advocated for transparent ramp fees, hangar use, Recreational Use Statutes, and turf operating areas, and responded to noise complaints. Ongoing issues include preventing monopolistic FBO pricing, preserving airspace and preventing obstructions like wind turbines and encroaching housing developments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ginter said current casework includes over 400 airports, adding, “We don’t say ‘no’ to any airport issue” that AOPA members bring to them. Some are big closure issues, and some are as simple as renewing airport leases, he said.</p> <p>This year is the 25th anniversary of AOPA’s Airport Support Network, and a few RAF liaisons serve as ASN volunteers, what Ginter called “The eyes and ears, our early warning system at each airport.” AOPA now has 2,000 such volunteers, and is inviting more people to get involved&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aopa.org/advocacy/airports-and-airspace/airport-advocacy/asn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Anyone may access AOPA’s Resource Library <a href="https://aopa.org/advocacy/airports-and-airspace/airport-advocacy/resources">here</a>.</p> <p>The chat turned to Adam Williams, AOPA’s Airport Policy Manager who interacts with the FAA, and educates policy makers on the value of GA and airports. Bill Dunn, Aviation Strategies Consultant – who started the ASN system – also spoke briefly.</p> <p>Each Regional Manager then summarized their specific issues, and invited RAF liaisons to respond with regional concerns. Topics they raised ranged from approval of turf operating areas; Wakulla, Florida’s tabling the vote to terminate its airport lease; preserving Alaska’s fly-in cabins, the reclamation of Childs Glacier strip, and adding Alaska weather stations and cameras; Washington state aviation fuel tax allocations; charting Oregon and Utah’s recreational strips; Idaho’s funding surplus that could result in lowering aircraft sales tax, and upcoming housing developments at McCall, Donnelly, and Cascade.</p> <p>The RAF appreciates its successful relationship with AOPA, and specifically thanks each of these executives for their participation on September’s Fire Hub Chat.</p> <p>Here is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aopa.org/advocacy/state-advocacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOPA’s website</a>&nbsp;displaying each region.

Due to public comment opposing closure, the commissioners tabled the vote, postponing action and leaving the many airpark landowners with an uncertain future. The Tarpine Owner&#8217;s Association is the local HOA that has for decades tried to find funding sources for the airport&#8217;s upkeep. Florida State Aeronautics recognizes the airport’s value, and has offered no-match funds, but responsibility for maintenance is still a tangled issue with the county.</p> <p>The RAF Call To Action resulted in many favorable comments. Supporters showed up at the meeting with a survey conducted September 2-7 among random area voters that showed 86% of county residents favor keeping&nbsp;Wakulla&nbsp;Airport, 2J0 open. “One of those supporters is Bill Russell, the volunteer fireman who was saved after he was life flighted from the airport a decade ago,” the Tallahassee Democrat reported.</p> <p>Pamela Brownell, director of Franklin County Emergency Management, had pointed out that the airport is essential as a staging area to distribute disaster emergency supplies. During Hurricane Michael the airport became a safe area to drop supplies for county residents. The airport’s strategic location may have become especially obvious due to the effects of Hurricane Ian.&nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF has repeatedly expressed support as far back as 2021, with a letter to the Commissioners stating in part, “Our volunteers seek to engage positively and cooperatively with airport entities, communities, pilots and non-pilots, and other key stakeholders in helping airfields thrive.”</p> <p>The RAF will report on future developments at&nbsp;Wakulla.</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 30, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

She flew a Piper Tomahawk until it was sold in preparation for a move to Alaska in 1980. Once in Alaska and since that time, husband Ray Ballantyne (WA Ambassador) has done all the flying in the various planes they have owned over the years. As a result, Lisa has about 2500 hours of right seat time.<br><br>Lisa has always loved the outdoors, and grew up camping and backpacking. Fly-in camping added to the experience as she and Ray could get into the wilderness and mountains without having to carry backpacks. They first flew into Schafer Meadows in 1979, and recognized the magic of the experience of flying to such a pristine place to camp out. Then they discovered Idaho backcountry and now spend a good portion of the summer flying into backcountry strips in Idaho and Washington. Favorite places are Moose Creek, Thomas Creek and Sullivan Lake. And the Lodge at Big Creek is in a class of its own!<br><br>When not flying and camping out, Lisa spends time hiking the Olympic Mountains with a local hiking group, playing golf, or just walking and talking with friends.<br><br>Lisa is excited to do her part to advance The RAF mission as a VP of Appreciation, alongside her husband, Ray.</p> <p><a href="mailto:lballantyne@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lballantyne@theraf.org</a></p> <p><em>Submitted on September 15, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

Please arrive before dusk. Per NOTAM, field lights will be turned off that evening. A cookout will take place Friday night followed by the Sangamon&nbsp;Astronomical&nbsp;Society and other volunteers providing a dozen high-powered telescopes and viewing guidance. Breakfast will be served Saturday for fly-in campers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The airport has a courtesy car for those wishing to spend the night in town. Check Airbnb for lodging options. For more information about the event, call 309-253-3300 or 309-397-6926.</p> <p>For more information about Havana, what Purpura calls “a great little airstrip and small town in one of the few backwaters of Illinois,” visit <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;gZeEObmftuSjnPTYoILuhttps://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/2b725414-ce53-49ba-a843-0f33f479bdae/overview?searchQuery=Havana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p>&#8220;Havana, IL is a gem. In the roaring ‘20’s the Chicago gangsters loved coming down to relax, hunt ducks and buy hand rolled cigars from the local shops,” said Purpura. “You can still relax, and hunt ducks. You just have to bring your own cigars and enjoy them around the RAF campfire ring.”</p> <p><em>Submitted August 31, 2022</em></p> ]]>

Airstrips do not have driving wheels and once landed, do not go “off trail.” Noise from aircraft is transient and of short duration.</li><li>Airstrips are situated on natural flat land features, such as level, open meadows with little occurrence of soil disturbance or erosion.</li><li>Airstrips provide vital access to aid Search and Rescue, emergency response, and firefighting.</li><li>Airstrips offer possible life-saving options when small aircraft encounter mechanical problems or deteriorating weather conditions while flying over the relatively hostile terrain in southern Utah.</li><li>Airstrips are an excellent resource to the administrative needs for supervising the lands.</li><li>Airstrips transcend the need for roads and offer widely dispersed recreation activities.</li><li>Peer-reviewed research substantiates that small aircraft noise has no detrimental impact on wildlife.</li><li>Backcountry airstrips offer recreational access to the disabled and those with limited mobility and without the need for strenuous physical activity to enjoy our public lands.</li><li>Airstrips are trailheads: aviators are non-motorized recreationists, participating in hiking, camping and other low-impact activities.</li></ul> <ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Backcountry aviation offers a positive economic impact, with aviation fuel sales, food and lodging, sale of provisions and supplies, and other tourist-related support for the surrounding communities.</li><li>The Recreational Aviation Foundation and the Utah Backcountry Pilots have successfully renewed MOUs in place with the BLM to provide cooperative maintenance of backcountry airstrips.</li></ul> <p><strong>Your public comments count.</strong><br><strong>Thank you for helping preserve these unique and priceless backcountry aviation assets.</strong></p> <p>Here are the nine airstrips affected:<br><br>Boulder &#8211; 37.88548 N / 111.46342 W<br>Bowington &#8211; 37.77606 N / 111.39434 W<br>Cedar Wash &#8211; 37.66053 N / 111.54239 W<br>Collet Top &#8211; 37.45633 N / 111.467 W<br>Colt Mesa &#8211; 37.74 N / 111.08834 W<br>Escalante Canyon &#8211; 37.5323 N / 111.7063 W<br>Grand Bench &#8211; 37.27334 N / 111.195 W<br>Pilot Knoll &#8211; 37.24317 N / 111.491 W<br>Squaw Bench &#8211; 37.36817 N / 111.66333 W</p> ]]>

It’s always moving and you can hear popping, groaning, and booms like cannon fire.&nbsp;Of course, a highlight of the experience is a calving event seen and heard from the relatively short span from the campground across the Copper River to the face.”</p> <p>Clayton was successful obtaining $50,000 from the USFS for brushing out and lengthening this strip, that provides access to the Copper River, and the USFS campground. The campground has a glacier viewing platform, pavilion, grills, potable water, fire rings, picnic shelters, toilets, trash receptacles and bear boxes.&nbsp;He obtained an RAF grant to provide bicycles at the airstrip for use to explore the area.</p> <p>An Alaska Trails Crew worked for three weeks with chainsaws and brush cutters with metal blades, clearing four-inch alders that had encroached on the airstrip, and removed them with a four-wheeler and trailer. The crew finished on August 15. “A big thank you to Lucas &#8220;Luke&#8221; Borer, a local landowner who provided river transportation for the trails crew, materials and a four-wheeler,” Clayton said. A brush mower for future work is needed on site. “The Forest Service funds were put to good use, and there is money left over for future work,” he said.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2821-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12523" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2821-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2821-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2821-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Alaska Trails Crew, from L to R: Megan Khodl, Andy Lovins, Sarris&nbsp;Harris, Rachel Peterson</figcaption></figure> <p></p> <p>This week RAF volunteer Troy Tirrell is on site with a USFS survey crew surveying the airfield, and eventually it will be listed in the Airfield Guide.</p> <p>“There will need to be a volunteer work party before the end of the year to do some more clearing on the airfield,” Clayton said.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2825-3-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12525" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2825-3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2825-3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2825-3.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Andy Lovins</figcaption></figure> <p>“The airfield is open for use for bush aircraft that can land in a thousand feet,” Clayton said.

She earned her pilot certificate in her 20s and&nbsp;flew for the next few years, but like a lot of us, flying was set on the back burner. “I returned to aviation with grit and determination to knock out old goals. I’m a strong advocate for rusty and lapsed pilots,” she says.</p> <p><br>She earned high performance, complex, and tailwheel endorsements, and is instrument rated.&nbsp;She&nbsp;received her&nbsp;Single Engine Seaplane rating in a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver.&nbsp;Her older brother, “who was&nbsp;a regular at Montana’s 8U2, Schafer Meadows,” interested her in backcountry flying years ago. Prior to moving to Alaska, Stef lived out West, where she spent time learning backcountry and mountain flying basics throughout Wyoming and Montana. A self-proclaimed mountain junkie, Stef enjoys backcountry camping, hiking, backpacking and cross-country skiing.</p> <p>&#8220;The RAF mission allows me to combine my love of aviation with my passion for backcountry outdoor recreation,” she says. “I’m excited to help support the RAF mission and projects in Alaska with my fellow state liaisons, ambassadors, and volunteers.”</p> <p>Stef and her husband own two experimental Cub-type airplanes and a Cessna Cardinal. They live on a runway near Palmer, Alaska. She is also the Chair of the Mat-Su Valley 99s Chapter. When she’s not doing something aviation-related, Stef manages a team of oncology nurses for a pharmaceutical company.</p> <p>Stef joins RAF Liaisons Al Clayton and Jeff DeFreest in Alaska. <br>(907) 982-7833<br><a href="mailto:sgoza@theraf.org" rel="sponsored nofollow">sgoza@theraf.org</a><br></p> <p></p> ]]>

Ancestors of the Nez Perce Tribe first occupied the region in 1,400 A.D. followed by Cayuse, Shoshone and Bannock peoples. The Wilderness Act of 1964 placed the area in the National Wilderness Preservation System.&nbsp;</p> <p>The two airfields are accessible only by aircraft or an eight-mile-long trail from the nearest road. Minam Lodge is privately owned, while Red’s is a public facility administered by the USFS.</p> <p>Supporters of the RAF, the Idaho Aviation Association (IAA), and the Wallowa County Pilots Association (WCPA) collaborate to maintain and improve both airfields. “Recent successful efforts in the Eagle Cap demonstrate the dedication of the recreational aviation community, irrespective of their individual affiliations, to the preservation of these important assets,” RAF Oregon Liaison Richard&nbsp;Mayes&nbsp;said.</p> <p>As designated Wilderness, motorized equipment within the Eagle Cap is generally prohibited. The airfield at Red’s has been mowed&nbsp;for many years using an old mule-drawn mower. In 2021 the USFS provided a grant to purchase and deliver a new mower. “This July, volunteers led by RAF Oregon Ambassador Bill Ables mowed the airfield behind dear old friends Bird and Bat, two lovely mules owned by Jim and Holly Akenson,”&nbsp;Mayes&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The airfield is now in beautiful condition and ready for campers,” Ables said, adding, “We appreciate the Forest Service for their support, and the many volunteers who helped complete the work.”</p> <p>Due to the remote location of these airfields, accurate weather information has been non-existent. At the Minam Lodge airfield, supporters recently completed a year-long project to install webcams, in collaboration with the USFS and Minam Lodge owner Barnes Ellis. Dr. Paul Collins and Greg Bales, along with Ables, completed many flights to Minam with equipment and personnel.&nbsp;“The success of the project was dependent on Paul Poorman’s technical support for solving technical problems,” Ables said. Assisting on-site was Joseph Aviation Charter School student, Eon Goodrich.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="754" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/minamstation.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12370" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/minamstation.png 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/minamstation-300x226.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/minamstation-768x579.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>Eon Goodrich (on the ground) assisting Dr. Paul Collins, Greg Bales (on portion) and Paul Poorman (on top) installing web cams at Minam Lodge</figcaption></figure> <p>“The willingness of supporters to dedicate their time, money and effort, and to collaborate together, in order to protect and enhance our backcountry experiences is awesome,”&nbsp;Mayes&nbsp;added.</p> <p><em>Submitted August 12, 2022</em></p> ]]>

For many years there was no maintenance at the airfield. Due to overgrown sagebrush and bunch grasses, and extensive wildlife damage, the dirt runway became virtually unusable. In 2019 the Forest Service considered Silver Lake to be a safety hazard and had started the process of delisting the airfield. The RAF approached the USFS District Ranger and Aviation Officer, volunteering to provide annual airfield maintenance if the USFS would cancel the planned delisting.</p> <p>In the spring of 2020, RAF supporters and Oregon Pilots Association members removed brush, mowed and graded the airfield, and erected a new RAF windsock. “Impressed with the dedication exhibited by the RAF and OPA, the Forest Service has now taken over the regular surface maintenance of the airfield,” Mayes pointed out.</p> <p>The RAF collaborates with USFS Region 6 and responsible District Rangers to maintain a number of backcountry airfields in Oregon. “Our strong base of RAF supporters, who are willing to donate their time, labor and cash, are crucial in preserving these important assets for future generations of pilots,” Mayes said.</p> <p>For information about Silver Lake USFS airfield see the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/af375e6f-54c3-453a-bd59-19d571d2b62c/overview?searchQuery=silver+Lake">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on July 28, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

A group of about a dozen volunteers arrived early on the July 15-17 weekend and joined Washington State DOT Airport Manager Paul Wolf on the work. They removed small trees in the approach end of Runway 16, replaced damaged reflectors and did general clean up.

They provided a &#8216;Milk Can Cooker&#8217; dinner, consisting of a variety of grilled sausages and boiled vegetables Saturday night. Guests brought salads and desserts and no one went away hungry. Wolf stayed for the meal and campfire and answered questions about other state recreational airports, and complimented the RAF and the local chapter of Washington Pilots Association for successful cooperation with WSDOT. &nbsp;</p> <p>Sullivan Lake is near Metaline Falls, in the northeast corner of Washington State in the Colville National Forest, and the shoreline of the 1,290-acre lake has no structures other than East and West Sullivan Lake Campgrounds – adjacent to the airport – and Noisy Creek Campground at the far (south) end of the lake.</p> <p>The warm weather made the 312-ft deep pristine lake very appealing, and folks cooled off in the chilly water while some stayed dry paddleboarding.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/f0256357-4ef9-4e74-aea5-3b73b53fe193/overview?searchQuery=sullivan">Airfield Guide</a> for more information.</p> <p><em>Submitted on July 29, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

RAF volunteers have worked to return the airstrip to a safe condition for backcountry use.</p> <p>Red Pine, a remote 2,470-ft paved airfield lies along the St. John – or Wolastoq River – just a dozen miles from Quebec. It was originally built by the International Paper Company as a facility for forest management. The Nature Conservancy has owned the St. John River Forest since 1998, and manages the property to conserve biodiversity, provide wildlife habitat, and produce forest products. Most of the surrounding forest in the region is privately owned and continues to be managed for timber harvest.</p> <p>In response to wide regional interest in reopening Red Pine, in September of 2009 John Nadeau of Massachusetts – the RAF’s first volunteer east of the Mississippi – initiated dialog with The Nature Conservancy’s Maine Field office. He requested consideration of restoration and maintenance of the airfield by volunteers, writing, “This airstrip is a wonderful resource for access to the area for forest management and fire suppression in addition to recreational flying.” RAF Maine Liaisons Andy Rowe and Steve Mason, and RAF supporter John Sowles re-ignited discussions with The Nature Conservancy, which have resulted in the agreement. In part, it states:</p> <p>“Licensee (the RAF) has expertise in developing and maintaining airstrips and has adequate funding to improve and maintain the existing Airstrip and additional supporting appurtenances . . .”</p> <p>“We’re excited that twelve years later, we have an agreement with The Nature Conservancy that will allow us to restore the Red Pine airstrip and allow recreational aviation use,” says Rowe.</p> <p>“This success with The Nature Conservancy is an example of RAF’s role in building relationships for recreational aviation use on private lands,” Mason said, who pointed out that most of the recreational airfields in the East are privately owned.</p> <p>This is the second formal agreement the RAF has with TNC. In 2014, the two organizations cooperated to build a new airfield above the King’s River in the Ozarks of Arkansas called Trigger Gap.</p> <p>The North Maine Woods organization manages public access and maintains recreational facilities throughout the northern part of the state. “Steve and I intend to work closely with North Maine Woods,” Rowe said. “They are responsible for management of the campsite at the south end of the strip.” The License Agreement states that the RAF is responsible for the airfield and aircraft parking area at the northern end. Pilots and all visitors to Red Pine will be obligated to pay day-use and camping recreational fees to North Maine Woods.</p> <p>Rowe claims good muskie fishing in the St. John River, colorful fall foliage, and access to good hunting from Red Pine. “Flying in saves hours of driving on logging roads,” he added. He thanks Bill Sylvester and Lisa Reese of the Maine Aeronautics Association and her husband, Steve Williams of the Seaplane Pilots Association, “who have been very helpful for over a decade,” he said. In addition to its value for recreational access to the upper St John River within the vast north Maine woods, maintenance of the airstrip by RAF will also support its availability for emergency services.</p> <p>For information on Red Pine, see the <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;IzRVbeuFFUvaSxxAavNo">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 30, 2022</em></p> ]]>

Visitors to Rager can see historical buildings built by the Civilian Conservation Corps.</p> <p>Mayes started working on safety and reclamation projects at Rager in 2020, using an RAF grant to organize volunteers and the use of donated equipment to mow the 2,800-ft strip, clear brush, repair the runway surface, install a windsock and pole, and clear an aircraft parking area. Volunteers also constructed a stone fire ring near a donated picnic table in the camping area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The recent work was completed at both airstrips in order to prepare a current report to the USFS, and to update entries in the Airfield Guide. For current listings, see&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;kxmUJwLEKfKJKEiWZrCl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rager</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;cWwrewILEqGeiJhaCyuH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Rock Flat</a>.</p> <p>“The RAF collaborates with USFS Region 6 and the responsible District Rangers to maintain a number of backcountry airfields in Oregon,” Mayes added.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on July 9, 2022</em></p> ]]>

RAF Alaska Liaison Al&nbsp;Clayton&nbsp;saw this as an opportunity for the RAF to cooperate in the creation and improvement of Childs Glacier Airstrip to access “a truly a world class location.” He explained that the Childs Glacier calves icebergs into the Copper during July, “when the sockeye run is hot, sometimes washing salmon up into the alders on the near side. This location is the natural take out at the end of a multi-day rafting trip of 80 miles or so on the Copper River, as well,” he added.</p> <p>Childs Glacier airstrip has been initially funded by a $50,000 USFS multi-year project grant. The bulk of the work will be to brush out and extend the airstrip to approximately 80 by 1,800 feet and the airstrip is expected to be useable by August 1, 2022. Alaska Airmen’s Association has contributed a significant grant as well, and will cooperate on volunteer work.&nbsp;</p> <p>Clayton&nbsp;was awarded an RAF grant to pay for the purchase and seasonal storage of four bicycles for visitors to access the USFS campground one mile away; installation of aircraft tie-downs, and an RAF windsock. “Local Cordova RAF supporter Troy Tirrell offered to retrieve and store the bicycles at his home in Cordova during the winter and return them to the airstrip in spring,”&nbsp;Clayton&nbsp;said. Lodge Owner Luke Borer has offered to shelter the bicycles at his bunkhouse near the airstrip for the convenience of visitors.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Childs-Glacier-bikes-Al-Clayton-grant.jpeg-.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11951" width="838" height="629" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Childs-Glacier-bikes-Al-Clayton-grant.jpeg-.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Childs-Glacier-bikes-Al-Clayton-grant.jpeg--300x225.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Childs-Glacier-bikes-Al-Clayton-grant.jpeg--768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></figure> <p>In summer 2023, it is expected that the USFS will use remaining funds from the $50,000 allocation to mobilize equipment to further groom the airstrip surface and move some nearby rock hazards.</p> <p>Clayton&nbsp;encourages visitors to plan to fly in and take in the local history. “The railroad history is fabulous,” he added.

Volunteers removed encroaching brush, cleaned up the camping and picnic areas, and repaired damaged signs and fences.</p> <p>Mayes noted that with the continued efforts of RAF volunteers, several backcountry airfields in Oregon including McKenzie Bridge, have been significantly improved over the past several years. “I want to express my appreciation to these many supporters for their continued dedication to the RAF mission,” he added.</p> <p>Useful information and a Safety Briefing are available at <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/fbe82ea4-7900-4b4d-8e6f-7651cc30b541/overview?searchQuery=mcke">Airfield Guide</a>, and information about its nearby outdoor attractions can be found in this RAF <a href="https://theraf.org/featured-airstrip-mckenzie-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 14, 2022</em></p> ]]>

In addition to recreational use, healthy turf will benefit state and federal firefighting operations, Parker pointed out.</p> <p>For more information on this spectacular fly-in&nbsp;destination, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;OCiDeuOJMewsGIwVPAkH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted June 14, 2022</em></p> ]]>

It’s&nbsp;amazingly beautiful with beaches, rugged coastlines, waterfalls, boreal forests, bears, moose, the Pictured Rocks, Porcupine Mountains, hidden lakes with huge fish, and blue-ribbon trout streams. There are few places in the world where you can, in a single day, experience beaches with black sand, yellow sand, pink sand, and sugar white sand.&nbsp;</p> <p>I am not the product of an aviation family, but I had always wanted to fly. I started training when I was an older teen in Tucson, AZ, trading work for flight time. After delays, I obtained my license in 2013. In 2020 I decided to use aviation to fully enjoy Michigan’s&nbsp;recreational offerings so I sold my Midget Mustang and purchased my 1940 Piper J5 Cub, selected for its three-seat configuration and its ruggedness, that I could adapt to my style of flying. The Cub allows me to enjoy recreational and backcountry aviation in my beloved Michigan with my children and friends, creating amazing memories.</p> <p>In 2022 when RAF Michigan Liaison Brad Fredrick asked if I would be interested in an expanded volunteer role with the RAF, it took longer to utter the word “yes” than it did to think about it. The RAF represents everything I love about aviation and I was flattered to be asked to be a part of the RAF’s&nbsp;important mission. North Fox Island and Two Hearted Airstrip are privileges we would not be able to enjoy had it not been for Brad’s&nbsp;efforts and persistence. To be asked by Brad to protect that legacy, and to build upon it was a true gift. &nbsp;</p> <p>I own a hangar in Brighton, Michigan (45G) and enjoy hosting friends, family, colleagues, and pets. My home airport is privately owned by an association with both hangar homes and hangar rows. It’s&nbsp;an amazing aviation community with a lot of diversity, and also has a very warm feeling to it. Few places offer a Mitchell B-25 restoration project, along with other warbirds. You often see families, walking their dogs, and pushing strollers. I encourage everyone to stop in – I am always happy to get distracted by hangar flying.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="mailto:ggrant@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ggrant@theraf.org</a><br>313-912-6161</p> ]]>

His maternal grandfather was a corporate pilot, instructor and A&amp;P. “Their early influences set the path for a lifetime of flying both professionally and recreationally,” Karl says.</p> <p>Karl attended college in North Dakota in 1987 and earned ratings and experience swiftly. Instructing – including aerobatics and tailwheel – charter, predator control, air ambulance, and freight hauling all added experience toward his career as a major airline pilot.</p> <p>He met his future wife, Kari, while they both were employed at an FBO in Minot, North Dakota in the early ‘90s. They settled in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and raised&nbsp;two sons while Kari taught school for 25 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>Along the way, the couple bought aircraft and built a hangar at Sturgis Airport (49B). Beginning in 1998 with a 1946 J-3, a Cessna 180J followed in 2009. Most recently, a 1959 K35 Bonanza has been added.&nbsp;</p> <p>Currently, they balance their time between home in the Black Hills, helping with Kari’s family farm in North Dakota, and float flying the 180 from the Alaska lake cabin.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I look forward to expanding recreational flying destinations within South Dakota and utilizing the resources and fellowship the RAF offers,” Karl says.</p> <p>605-574-0130<br><a href="mailto:kjungclaus@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kjungclaus@theraf.org</a>.</p> ]]>

To ensure its official public-use status, RAF and local volunteers removed brush and cleared trees. Airport Manager Tim Kaseno secured cones per Aeronautics’ directions to mark the runway.</p> <p>Russell began with an RAF grant for the pilot shelter, that local volunteers helped finish out, picnic tables, and a bicycle shed with donated bicycles. They created a camping area where visitors are welcome to tent beneath their wings. “Huge thanks to all the volunteers from both the town and the RAF that helped to get the airport improved to meet the requirements of public use. It&#8217;s been an amazing collaboration with literally dozens and dozens of folks from each group pitching in. And also a big thanks to the Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics for being so engaged and helpful,” Russell said.</p> <p>Landing on Cornucopia’s 1,920-foot turf runway puts you just a short bicycle ride to the Village with restaurants, shops, and lodging. A few miles away is the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.&nbsp;“The scenery is absolutely spectacular. There are incredible recreational opportunities in the area including kayaking to the sea caves, hiking to waterfalls and the shoreline above the caves, and trout fishing in a nearby stream,” Russell added.</p> <p>You are invited to Cornucopia’s third annual Solstice Fly-in, June 17-19, 2022, hosted by the airport. “Attendees are invited to camp under their wing, socialize, and take part in the many outdoor activities the area has to offer,” Hal Davis wrote in the June/July issue of&nbsp;<em>Midwest Flyer</em>&nbsp;digital magazine. Advance registration is required. Please visit the airport’s Facebook page at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/CornyAirport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>www.facebook.com/CornyAirport</strong></a>.</p> <p>You’ll see Cornucopia’s new green Public/Permissive dot at the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/44ba7358-4493-4036-8798-0b4e3ee12a2b/overview?searchQuery=cornu">Airfield Guide</a>. </p> <p>Our <a href="https://outfitter.theraf.org/collections/apparel/products/airstrip-hats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornucopia Airstrip Hats</a>, sporting the original identifier, WI23, on The RAF Outfitter are now a limited edition item!

Dr Clemente Izurieta, PhD oversees the program that is run by senior CS students. Students in this capstone class form teams and work with real companies and organizations to develop beneficial software. Representatives work with the students throughout the school year. The organization pays a donation to the program to help maintain the lab, and provide opportunity for students to attend tech conferences, for example.</p> <p>The RAF project created a simple user interface within the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airfield.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>&nbsp;to automate the creation and upload of a flight pack into ForeFlight. Software developer Chip Gibbons, of the Tailwind Aviation Foundation was most involved in helping with design, as he had the largest role in creating the Airfield Guide. “The team at Montana State was great to work with and their product will go a long way to making the information in the Airfield Guide available to folks when there is no internet access,” Gibbons said. It is ready for its rollout for general use.</p> <p>Three MSU students, Greg Fulbright, Lenin Lewis, and Josh Anderson teamed up on this project for the opportunity to work with real clients and create real products. “The Airfield Guide has become an important tool for aviators to discover and safely fly to incredible airfields that we all care about,” RAF President Bill McGlynn said.&nbsp;“This engagement with MSU&#8217;s Software Factory has been a great way to add value to the Airfield Guide, while sharing some real-world experience with these three graduating seniors,” he added.</p> <p>McGlynn, Gibbons, and RAF Marketing Director Kodi Myhre worked with the team throughout the 2021-2022 school year, beginning with design; devoting the second semester to building the product, meeting weekly. “It was a fun project,” Gibbons added.</p> <p>“We had a great time working with our team and are very happy with their final product,” Myhre said. “We appreciate everything Dr. Izurieta did to involve us with the Software Factory. It was a valuable experience for us and we&#8217;re thrilled to offer this product to continue improving the Airfield Guide.”</p> <p><em>Submitted May 31, 2022</em><br>Photo above: From L-R: Kodi Myhre, Josh Anderson, Lenin Lewis, Greg Fulbright</p> ]]>

With help from fellow RAF members Steve Johnson and Chip Gibbons, Powell organized accurate sound testing during a variety of actual aircraft operations. They concurred that a right traffic pattern on Runway 10 would reduce the noise in the vicinity of remote home tracts.</p> <p>“Communications are critical,” Powell said. He is sending a letter to each pilot who has registered at Trigger – over 300 so far – explaining the new operating procedure. In part, the letter states, “At the RAF we are always working to improve, and we want you to be aware of new procedures which will go into effect immediately to help improve the noise footprint . . .” He includes a copy of the RAF/Fly OZ Backcountry Stewardship document. The letter will be sent to all future users who sign in.&nbsp;</p> <p>The group came up with other mitigation ideas, and Goodwin reached out to the local flight school that has now stopped training at Trigger, other than rental checkouts.&nbsp;</p> <p>“We have the full support and involvement of The Nature Conservancy in being good stewards of their lands,” Powell said. We all feel that these actions will make us all better stewards of Trigger Gap and better backcountry pilots.”&nbsp;</p> <p>See the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/f6ed09bf-07ec-4302-96c8-9f80743ae0c4/overview?searchQuery=trigger">Airfield Guide</a> for this new information: LEFT hand pattern for RWY 28 and <strong>RIGHT</strong> <strong>hand pattern for RWY 10.</strong></p> <p><em>Photo by Jim Stevenson</em></p> <p><em>Submitted on April 30, 2022</em></p> ]]>

I was able to acquire an LP gas tank and it went from there.”&nbsp;Wyttenbach rounded up spindles for axles and heavy-duty bearings. He welded a frame and hitch from 3”x3” square steel tubing. He even included a hitch jack. The hitch can be unbolted for easier transporting. &nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6732-2-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11766" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6732-2-1.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6732-2-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6732-2-1-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure> <p>He expects that by filling it with water it will weigh 5,200 pounds, and make a perfect implement to smooth the runway. He designed plugs so it can be drained prior to northern Wisconsin’s freezing weather.</p> <p>Jim Stevenson lent RAF Director Jeff Russell his truck to haul it the five-and a half hours to Cornucopia.&nbsp;RAF supporter Joe McDonough chipped in for fuel.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_5917-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11764" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_5917-1.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_5917-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_5917-1-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption>RAF Director Jeff Russell hauled the roller to Cornucopia Airfield.</figcaption></figure> <p>“I am a fan of the RAF, and I just think that roller is going to be around a long time,” Wyttenbach said. Referring to the&nbsp;&#8220;RAF&nbsp;2022&#8221;&nbsp;he added, “When you weld it on, it’s pretty well stamped forever.”&nbsp;</p> <p>He made a very comprehensive video of his impressive process.

The Katama Airpark, 1B2 is a recreational turf airfield on the island, and the RAF has awarded a $10,000 grant toward a facility for pilots and passengers to gather, picnic, and enjoy&nbsp;direct access to the Atlantic Ocean. “First opened in 1924 as a Curtis Wright Training Center, Katama is a bucket list destination for pilots from around the world. Katama’s three grass runways are long enough for a DC3 and smooth enough for a Cirrus,” New Hampshire-Massachusetts Liaison John Meade explains.</p> <p>Katama Airfield is a town-owned, public use airfield. It was saved from commercial development by a partnership between The Nature Conservancy and the Town of Edgartown. “Because of this, Katama will forever be a recreational airfield,” Meade said.</p> <p>The Katama Airfield Trust is a non profit organization run by volunteers. Over the last 30 years the Trust has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to preserve and maintain the airfield. “Trust members, along with local pilots put in countless volunteer hours every year,” Meade said.</p> <p>Through these volunteer efforts over $1.5 million has been raised and over $3 million worth of additional land has been placed into conservancy.&nbsp;The RAF had&nbsp;previously&nbsp;contributed $9,800 of in-kind engineering services to&nbsp;help replace a dilapidated&nbsp;World War II hangar&nbsp;at the airfield. The hangar will serve as a meeting place&nbsp;for local groups to engage in aviation projects year-round.&nbsp;The hangar and pilot shelter are near completion but recent price escalations had left a budget shortfall, and this RAF grant should enable the project to be completed by June 2022.</p> <p>Top photo of Katama Airpark courtesy of Bill Brine.</p> <p><em>Submitted on April 28, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

It’s a huge win for recreational aviation. Kudos to the FAA for this logical approach to enhancing safety at airports.”</p> <p>These types of operations have&nbsp;been taking place at airports across the country, typically by tailwheel pilots, and this is the first time the FAA has officially&nbsp;recognized these areas.&nbsp;There is still a process to go through before turf operations can be authorized. The FAA requires the airport owner to request that a turf operations area be established. The local FSDO must ensure that operations in the proposed area can take place safely in order to approve it.</p> <p>Russell points out relevant language in the new section on Diverse Aeronautical Activities on Airports. In subsection 2.10.6, the FAA now recognizes operations on turf areas adjacent to paved runways:</p> <p>“Pilots of certain aircraft (such as ultralights, powered-parachutes, helicopters, gliders, agricultural aircraft, tailwheels, aircraft with large balloon type “tundra” tires, etc.) occasionally use the unpaved portion of the RSA adjacent to a runway for takeoffs, landings, or other operations (e.g., banner towing).&nbsp;</p> <p>“While this document&nbsp;does not guarantee&nbsp;these operations at all airports, it should ease the way to get them allowed on an official basis at many airports across the country,” Russell added.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted April 15, 2022</em></p> ]]>

A formal agreement was signed between the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, (TPWD) and the Recreational Aviation Foundation on March 18, 2022.</p> <p>“This is far more than an agreement to provide volunteers and RAF grant money for projects in Texas,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said. “The State of Texas is looking to the RAF for expertise and guidance on managing aviation assets in their parks while identifying new opportunities to provide additional recreational access.”&nbsp;RAF Texas Liaison Tres Clinton worked closely with Texas State Representative and RAF member John Cyrier on this MOU.&nbsp;Rep. Cyrier said, “After our accomplishments in the legislative session, we believed this was the right next step to formalize the partnership between the RAF and TPWD.”&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement also authorizes the RAF to assist TPWD in “planning future recreation aviation opportunities by proposing areas and airstrips to be utilized for recreational aviation access and purposes.”</p> <p>TPWD will collaborate with the RAF when opportunities arise for participation in public planning, implementation, and evaluation of land, water, and waterways for projects designed to enhance aviation access to state parks.</p> <p>Reflecting the RAF Code of Ethics, the document states, “Each pilot is an ambassador to the non-flying public.” Pilots are expected to act with courtesy for those on the ground by maintaining reasonable distance and altitude and avoiding low level flights, unsafe operation, and excessive noise.</p> <p>While signing the document, McKenna said, “This is an exciting day for all and hopefully the beginning of a long-term relationship that all will find beneficial.” Rep. Cyrier added, “Both of these groups are top notch. What a great accomplishment for both.”</p> <p><em>Photo: Tres Clinton left and John Cyrier in front of Tres’s Super Cub showing the symbolic stickers of Texas Parks and Wildlife and the RAF.</em></p> <p><em>Submitted on March 31, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

Butchie and her husband, the late Ben Ryan had generously donated their northwest Montana airfield property to the RAF so it could be shared with the public forever. The RAF was not only blessed with the gift of land, it was enriched with Ryans’ friendship and their life story. </p> </div></div> <p><br>RAF Chairman John McKenna said, “From the first time I met the Ryans in 2002, until Butchie’s passing these twenty years later, the Ryans were an example of lives very well lived. Generosity and humility are two traits that come to mind.”</p> <p>Agnes Butchkosky was raised in Jeddo, PA, daughter of a hard rock miner who’d emigrated from Austria as a teenager. Butchie’s mother managed to care for the family of seven in spite of labor strikes. Butchie’s father brought home empty wooden charge boxes for the children to play with. “I turned mine into a desk for my nurse’s station,” she recalled, and following that passion, she graduated from nursing school in 1944.</p> <p>She was determined to join the Army Nurse Corps, even though she was too short. She piled her hair on top of her head with plenty of hairpins. It made her just tall enough. “Our generation was willing to step up and it was what I wanted to do,” she said.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:34% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="363" height="490" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-Ryan-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4319 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-Ryan-5.png 363w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-Ryan-5-222x300.png 222w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Butchie was assigned to the hospital ship, <em>Republic</em> to serve the injured soldiers anticipated in the planned invasion of Japan. The ship broke down near the Panama Canal and waited a month for parts. Ben Ryan, a dashing Army Lieutenant flying Lockheed P-38 Lightnings on sub patrol, was stationed at Howard Air Force Base nearby. He’d survived bailing out of his P-38, possibly something they talked about during that blind date that changed their lives forever.<br><br>After the War, Butchie was stationed at the Army Hospital in Aurora, CO to treat tuberculosis patients. Following their nine-month courtship, Ryans were married in a Denver hospital chapel on June 8, 1946.</p> </div></div> <p><strong><em>Agnes “Butchie” Ryan, 1922-2022</em></strong></p> <p>Ben was honorably discharged and roughnecked on an oil well near Livingston, MT.</p> <p>Stanford was their home for the next three years where Ben earned his petroleum engineering degree while Butchie worked in the Palo Alto Hospital.</p> <p>Ben’s career with Richfield Oil began in September 1949, and his duties sent the couple near Bakersfield, then to Wyoming, and Caracas, Venezuela where they left amidst the chaos of a military coup. They transferred to Los Angeles, then to Alaska in 1961. Butchie was cooking moose stew for guests when the 1964 earthquake hit. The whole house pitched and swayed, and they hurried to high ground in the car to avoid a possible tsunami wave.</p> <p>Ben was responsible for Alaska oil exploration. When his field crew reported promising oil sands near Prudhoe Bay, Ben agreed that Richfield should invest in it, and he and his crew were credited with the discovery of the North Slope oil field.</p> <p>After retiring, they bought a quarter section of forest near West Glacier, MT in 1966. They built an A-frame home, and Ben designed and built a sawmill from which he sawed lumber to build a shop, outbuildings and hangar where he built several aircraft.</p> <p>Their land could accommodate a 2,500-foot turf runway, and Ben cleared trees, and filled low spots with a one-and-a-half-yard front loader to create meadow-like Ryan Field, at the base of Strawberry Mountain.</p> <p>Butchie saw yellow and purple iris growing wild along the highway and took the liberty to transplant a few bulbs around their home. They flourished, and she freely gave bulbs to others so they could enjoy the cheerful Spring color.<br></p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:38% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="675" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ben-Ryan-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-947 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ben-Ryan-2.jpg 900w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ben-Ryan-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ben-Ryan-2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>In 2005, Ryans began incrementally donating their property to the RAF so the airfield could be used by the public in perpetuity. In 2008, Ryan Field was dedicated at a fly-in and barbecue. The honored couple held hands and enjoyed the camaraderie throughout the June weekend.</p> </div></div> <p></p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 45%"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Butchies_Iris_50-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11439 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Butchies_Iris_50-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Butchies_Iris_50-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Butchies_Iris_50-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Butchies_Iris_50-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Butchies_Iris_50.jpg 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p>Ben and Butchie moved to the Montana Veteran’s Home in Columbia Falls in 2012, and Ben passed away at age 94 in July of 2017. Now when the yellow and purple iris bloom around Ryan Field, it will serve as a tribute to Butchie and her love for the land and its beauty.</p> </div></div> <p></p> <p>Visitors quickly realize that Ryan Field, 2MT1 is a treasure, and are grateful for the opportunity to enjoy recreational aviation in its beautiful setting so close to Glacier National Park. The RAF will be forever grateful for this opportunity to be stewards of the property, and the Ryan Legacy.</p> <p><em>A memorial service with military honors was held graveside Tuesday, March 22 at the Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Columbia Falls, MT</em>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on March 16, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

If her Super Cub has to wait out the “soggy turf” season at her home airfield of Ferndale, she can be found on the slopes of Whitefish Mountain or out riding one of her horses along the Flathead River, or she might be helping her husband RAF Director Mike Perkins refresh duck boxes in time for merganser and wood duck nesting season at their home along the Swan River. The couple moved to Montana from their mile-high airfield home in Berthoud, CO in 2019, but have spent most summers at a second home in Bigfork since 2013. After settling into her new location fulltime, she wanted to connect with other active women so she started a women’s adventure group on Facebook, and it now has over 300 members. It has succeeded in connecting active women who enjoy all things outdoors like hiking, kayaking, paddle boarding, skiing and horseback riding.<br><br>Lynn was born in New York and raised in Connecticut. She met Mike at Purdue University while they were earning degrees in computer technology and business. Lynn graduated in 1997, and worked for Kiwanis International as a systems analyst and designed their new in-house IT system. As soon as they could, Lynn says, “we high-tailed it out of Indiana for the mountains of Colorado.” The couple settled in Boulder and started a tech company, which they ran for 22 years before selling in 2019.<br><br>Mike’s grandfather had been instrumental in New Hampshire aviation. Mike had always wanted to fly but his duties in the Air Force did not include flying. Lynn bought flying lessons for him in 1999 and “he took to it quickly, and had his Private within two months,” and purchased their Cessna 180 soon after. But Lynn was one of those who prefers to jump out of airplanes – especially when the jump ship was intentionally flown low on gas, and skydivers were instructed to &#8220;get out now” each time the engine quit aloft, so she was pretty leery of flying very far in small airplanes.<br><br>She decided to learn to fly to be a reliable backup for Mike. Her flight instructor made her uncomfortable when he told her he’d had a troubling vision of a tragic event that involved her in the Skywagon. A few years later, Lynn and Mike were flying home from Idaho’s backcountry with their German Shepherd when a rocker arm boss broke and they experienced immediate engine failure. “Mike was on top of his game,” Lynn said, and got it into an abandoned airstrip at nearly 8,500 feet MSL, safely landing downwind, since there was no windsock. “We were ninety seconds to the ground,” she said. An FAA representative told them that that kind of failure usually kills people. “After that emergency, I figured that was the event. I was free of bad omens and was much more comfortable flying the 180,” she explains.<br><br>Lynn’s heart was set on a Super Cub, and she borrowed from her 401k, and sold her beloved BMW sports car in order to buy one. Mike flew all over the West, and eventually found one in Billings in 2006 with about 1,500 hours on the engine. Lynn trusted Blackstone Labs for an oil analysis on the older engine, and so far, has flown her Cub over 1,000 hours more.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Lynn-Mareth2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11369" width="376" height="317" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Lynn-Mareth2.png 820w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Lynn-Mareth2-300x254.png 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Lynn-Mareth2-768x649.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></figure></div> <p><br>Lynn and Mike were very involved with the Cessna 180-185 Club and with Mike becoming a new Director, they hosted the Cody, Wyoming Skywagon Convention in 2011. Mike invited John McKenna to speak to the group about the RAF and it really inspired the couple to become more involved in the organization. It seemed to be exactly what they love about flying, especially since they now owned both a Cessna 185 and a Super Cub, both capable backcountry airplanes. Visitors to Ryan Field often see Lynn arrive in her red and white Super Cub with the big tires, but she hasn’t dropped in just to relax. Lynn is always one of the first to put gloves on and work hard. “I’m very proud of the work that has been done at Ryan Field by so many volunteers and I’m so grateful that it&#8217;s located in our flying backyard,” she says.<br><br>“We envision piling in the Skywagon, doing a cross-country, visiting all the RAF airstrips someday,” she says, adding, “North Fox Island was definitely a treat, and it’s amazing how the RAF has grown. It’s really exciting to see how it all started, where we are now, and to envision where we are going in the future.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on March 14, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

Annette earned her Private Pilot License in December of 2021 and is working on her tailwheel endorsement.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;They keep busy maintaining what Annette calls &#8220;The Harem&#8221; which includes the Champ, the Twin Comanche, a Falco and assorted Cub projects.</p> <p><br>&#8220;The aviation community is full of the nicest, most generous people who love to share their passion for flying. The RAF combines this passion with commitment and stewardship to the wilderness experience. This organization is a win/win and I&#8217;m thrilled to be included in it.&#8221;</p> <p>S<em>ubmitted on March 8, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

Located on the southern edge of Lake Winnipesaukee, Alton Bay is a seaplane base in the summer. But the boats, paddle boards and kayaks get stored for the New England winter, and pilots eagerly await the freeze. Once ice reaches a thickness of 12 inches, normally late January or early February, New Hampshire’s DOT Aeronautical Division gives the go-ahead to prepare it for ice landings. It closes temporarily depending on the outside temperature, but reopens when temperatures drop.</p> <p>**This article has been updated on 3/1/2022; please note that Alton Bay ice runway is now CLOSED for the 2022 winter season due to warming conditions, after multiple weeks of being open to pilots.</p> ]]>

It was developed by redwood mill owners Bud and Lud McCrary. Thanks to the family’s wishes to keep the airstrip active after Bud’s passing, and a generous RAF grant and volunteer help, the 800-foot strip was widened, graded, and stabilized. The RAF also provided a portable toilet, picnic table and gas grill.<br><br>Las Trancas lies immediately above the coast and a gentle path connects the airstrip to the beach and tide pools below. “The owners have authorized airplane-only camping, as long as tents are not visible from the highway,” RAF California Ambassador Jeremy Lezin said, adding, “As far as I know this is the&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>airstrip on the west coast that provides an ocean view from your tent!”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RAF-Las-Truncas.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11181" style="width:389px;height:259px" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RAF-Las-Truncas.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RAF-Las-Truncas-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/RAF-Las-Truncas-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div> <p>On Sunday, February 6, Lezin organized and hosted an impromptu barbecue along with RAF supporter Barry Porter and his wife Phyllis.

Although there is a gravel road to the site, it’s many miles from pavement, and flying in is a good alternative. It offers dry camping with views of the Upper Grand Wash Cliffs, and overnighters enjoy perfect dark skies. There is a windsock and tie-downs. The RAF is very pleased to announce the recent installation of a BLM vault toilet adjacent to the windsock. “The Utah Back Country Pilots Association is delighted to hear about the improvements made at Grand Gulch,” UBCP President Roy Evans said.<br></p> <p>Utah Back Country Pilots volunteers have spent many hours improving the condition of the strip. Located north of the Grand Canyon, Utah pilots have willingly taken on much of the volunteer work, typically joined by volunteers from Arizona Pilots Association, and RAF Utah Liaisons Wendy Lessig and Wayne Loeber.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>“We’re grateful to those who’ve contributed to these improvements, and look forward to flying south and turning one of our favorite places to visit in Arizona into a regular pit stop,” Evans added, (pun intended.)<br></p> <p>Several years ago, an RAF volunteer designed and built a composting toilet and notified the BLM that RAF volunteers were willing to install it on site. The BLM appreciated the offer, but instead, funded the installation of a concrete ADA vault toilet.<br></p> <p>Visitors will find interpretive signage while exploring the mine buildings, original shaft and equipment. Mining began at the site in 1885, and Bureau of Mines records indicate that between 1901 and 1951, the mine shipped 15,701 tons of ore which included 6.6 million pounds of copper, and 24,349 ounces of silver, and 715 pounds of lead.<br></p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/255ab0d0-77c3-4521-a4ad-0390c8fdfdc6/overview?searchQuery=grand+gulch">The Airfield Guide</a>.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="739" height="1024" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-739x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11139" style="width:267px;height:369px" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-739x1024.jpg 739w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-216x300.jpg 216w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-768x1065.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-1108x1536.jpg 1108w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-1477x2048.jpg 1477w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Grand-Gulch-toilet-interior-scaled.jpg 1846w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></figure></div> <p><em>Submitted on February 3, 2022.</em></p> ]]>

On January 31, RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton received approval from the US Forest Service for his RAF request for $50,000 to improve and expand the small airstrip just north and east of the glacier’s massive face. “We’re super excited about this good news,” Clayton said.</p> <p>Clayton, a life-long Alaskan, grew up near the headwaters of the Copper River and worked one summer for Alaska Department of Fish and Game at this location during college. He explains, “The Childs Glacier calves icebergs into the Copper in July when the sockeye run is hot, sending huge waves across the narrow river, sometimes washing salmon up into the alder bushes. This is the natural take-out at the end of a multi-day Copper River rafting trip upstream from Kennicott or Chitina. The scenery and topography are stunning. It is truly a world class location.”</p> <p>This airstrip lies just north of the 1910 “Million Dollar Bridge” constructed as part of the Copper River &amp; Northwestern Railroad which provided the first rail access from the tidewater port of Cordova, Alaska to interior Alaska. The rail line helped tap the incredibly rich Kennicott copper deposit developed by Stephen Birch with financial support from New York’s Guggenheim and Morgan families. “Books have been written on the challenges of bridge and trestle construction over glacial moraine; and the mining operations that developed in the area. The last ore train ran in 1938, and the towns of Kennicott and McCarthy emptied and alders started reclaiming the railroad right of way,” Clayton added.</p> <p>Eventually the right of way was conveyed to the State of Alaska. Fifty-two miles of rail outbound from Cordova were removed and the resulting road to Childs Glacier and the bridge was accessible by motor vehicle. After the 1964 earthquake, the State invested in bridge repairs and the Forest Service built a beautiful campground south of the bridge and across the river from the face of the Childs Glacier. However, modern washouts have destroyed bridges downstream from Million Dollar Bridge, and today the only access to a campground and bridge is over the treacherous river by riverboat; or the present short and narrow “Cub” strip. Adding 400 feet to its north end and cutting cottonwood trees from additional 200 feet will yield a reasonably safe bush strip, according to Clayton’s proposal.</p> <p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation thanks AOPA and Alaska Airmen’s Association for their support of this project, and is proud of its history of creating and improving airstrips for recreational access.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="572" height="430" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen_Shot_2022-02-02_at_8.57.50_PM_40.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11127" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen_Shot_2022-02-02_at_8.57.50_PM_40.png 572w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen_Shot_2022-02-02_at_8.57.50_PM_40-300x226.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><figcaption>Overview of Hazards</figcaption></figure></div> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-26 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="468" height="351" data-id="11129" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-2-1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11129" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-2-1-1.png 468w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-2-1-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /><figcaption>Large rock piles 22&#8242; from airstrip center line</figcaption></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="587" height="440" data-id="11130" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-5_49.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11130" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-5_49.jpg 587w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-5_49-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /><figcaption>Limited runaround area at north end</figcaption></figure> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="468" height="351" data-id="11131" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11131" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-1-1.png 468w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PastedGraphic-1-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /><figcaption>Brush at the north end</figcaption></figure> </figure> <p><em>Photos by Troy Tirrell</em></p> <p><em>Submitted on February 3, 2022</em>.</p> ]]>

After a flight to Death Valley over the dunes I was hooked,” Cindy Cross of San Carlos, CA says. Although Cindy is not herself a pilot, after 25 years in the family Cessna 206 she has earned her stripes as a proficient “right seat pilot, camp director and backcountry chef.”</p> <p>Cindy is very proud to have raised her son to be a pilot who also loves the backcountry. “I delight in finding new destinations for my family to fly into, and meeting people who share the love of flying,” she adds.</p> <p>In between projects assisting seniors to relocate to residential care homes, Cindy can be found somewhere in the West camping under the wing, biking, skiing, or backpacking, experiencing her love of the wilderness. Cindy’s favorite backpacking trip was the 221 mile John Muir Trail from Yosemite to the peak of 14,500-ft Mount Whitney. In addition to backcountry flying, she loves flights to Canada and Baja. Next on Cindy’s adventure list is to travel around Alaska by plane.</p> <p>“I have enjoyed the RAF’s many airstrips throughout our flying years. I look forward to supporting the RAF and helping it continue to thrive,&#8221; she adds. </p> ]]>

Davis was joined by RAF Georgia Liaison Kevin Barry and Ambassador Lou Furlong for a work party at this privately-owned coastal island airfield.</p> <p>The team mowed the runway and parking areas of palm and pine saplings, making space for additional aircraft. They cleared the understory near the bunkhouses and beat back saplings that had grown back since their work last year. “This affords a great sunrise view toward Sapelo Island and ensures we&#8217;ll have some much needed offshore airflow during the summer months,” Davis explained.</p> <p>Those interested in precision rifle shooting at this weekend&#8217;s event may sign up before Saturday, December 4 for target practice on the two-mile range on the east side of the island. An expert marksman will be on site, providing paid instruction and equipment resources on the .50 caliber. The airfield will be CLOSED during this Saturday activity. See NOTAMs and the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/d26c61ab-d1ca-4b67-b6be-3ea3d1a082fa/overview?searchQuery=creight">airfield.guide</a>. Aircraft spotters will be stationed in the 100-ft fire tower, monitoring ADS-B traffic and 122.9 for the presence of any aircraft within a three mile radius and below 2500 feet AGL. They will be in contact with the rifle range and all firing activities will be suspended if any aircraft enter the protected area.</p> <p>There is also an opportunity for a local fishing trip for 6-8 people. The boat will pick passengers up at the Creighton Island dock Saturday morning. The captain will take you to popular fishing spots within the protected areas along the Intracoastal Waterway. Expect the trip to be 4-6 hours in duration with drop-off back at Creighton.</p> <p>There is limited availability for these two activities, so this is first come, first served. </p> <p>Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:edavis@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edavis@theraf.org</a>&nbsp;for more details.</p> <p>To fly in other than for-scheduled events pilots must obtain permission from the owner. within 24 hours prior to arrival to obtain a runway report. For safety, no landings are authorized outside of scheduled events unless you have spoken with the owner. <strong>All pilots must review the airport briefing before operating on this field. See the Creighton Island Safety Briefing&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;EzXJfrLwuhrxbMdzcpzE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Volunteers Needed for Creighton Island Mowing</strong></p> <p>“We&#8217;re in need of pilots who are willing to share mowing tasks with those of us who have been doing this work on an irregular basis,” Georgia Ambassador Eric Davis said. The time commitment would be four to six hours per visit. Please email Davis at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:edavis@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edavis@theraf.org</a> for more information.</p> ]]>

Joe’s 35-years teaching Career and Technical education included woodworking, carpentry, and welding, and he readily puts his knowledge and experience to work as a volunteer. “I learned Tim Riley was trying to establish a campground at Driggs, Idaho. I reached out to him, offering financial help and skills. He suggested picnic tables so I got the material, welded up some frames. I flew to Driggs to camp and really enjoyed helping put up the gazebo, as well.” Ever since, Joe has shown up wherever he could, with tools and a great attitude, and projects materialized.</p> <p>The Ben and Butchie Ryan story intrigued Joe, and he flew into Ryan Field and got involved helping build the barn and cabins, all the while feeling a closeness with the late Ben Ryan. Joe’s father was a World War II fighter pilot stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack. “Like most veterans, he never talked about it,” Joe says. Like Ben, Joe’s father was forced to bail out over the Pacific, earning eligibility for membership in the “Caterpillar Club.” Airman Feiler narrowly avoided the fatal outcome of his formation partner. The flying boat intended to rescue Feiler was damaged in the landing due to rough seas, and had to be towed back to the harbor with a Naval vessel. He survived this ordeal, and wrote a detailed account of it. “I have Dad’s foot locker full of combat reports, photos, historical newspaper clippings and the letters he wrote from Pearl,” Joe says, who muses if perhaps his father and Ben Ryan may have ever crossed paths during their military service.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lt.-Col.-Feiler.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11020" width="628" height="461" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lt.-Col.-Feiler.jpg 792w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lt.-Col.-Feiler-300x220.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Lt.-Col.-Feiler-768x563.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /><figcaption><strong>Joe&#8217;s Dad, Lt. Col. W. J. Feiler </strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>After the war, Lt. Col. Feiler flew P-51 Mustangs for the Iowa National Guard. Joe was always intrigued with aviation, and enrolled in a ground school at an early age, but struggled to move forward in aviation as many younger people do, without good mentorship. He finally had the time to invest in getting his own license, “kind of coming to flying late, compared to some.” He learned to fly “in the wind” in Casper, partnered on a Cessna 182, got involved with the Civil Air Patrol, then bought his Cardinal. He says it was a breakthrough moment in his life. “Flying out of Casper, I suddenly realized how accessible the backcountry is. The airplane gives you the ability to get out early, set up camp, and you have the rest of the day to recreate.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Joe is an avid outdoorsman, enjoying backpacking, horse packing, and climbing, and says, “None of it has given me more enjoyment than aviation.” He sees a clear parallel to his passion for education. “When I got my pilot license, I was told it was my ticket to learn, and my chance to constantly improve my skills.” He admits the Cardinal is not commonly thought of as a backcountry plane, but with attention to conditions, it has taken Joe and his wife Julie into many Idaho and Montana backcountry fields.&nbsp;</p> <p>Joe has memberships in other professional and sport organizations, and says, “All organizations have their mission, but what I see that separates the RAF from other organizations is the great people. They share a passion for aviation and work hard toward common goals. I’ve never met a better group of people who enjoy working on a common cause, then enjoy sharing the fruits of their labor.”</p> <p>Having experienced Ryan Field, as much to work as to relax, he deeply appreciates that Ben and Butchie have shared the place with others. Next time you fly into Ryan Field, you may get the chance to meet Joe and Julie, as they have volunteered for camp host duties again. It’s likely that Joe will have his tools and will show you whatever improvements are underway.</p> <p><em>Top photo: Julie and Joe with their airplane at Ryan Field.</em></p> <p><em>Submitted on January 14, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

To honor this remarkable woman, we’re sharing a few highlights of her very full life. The RAF will be forever grateful to Butchie and her late husband Ben for donating their Ryan Field property near West Glacier, Montana to the RAF so it can be enjoyed by all. “Getting to one hundred is clearly a milestone, but getting there with a real story to tell is something more, and Butchie has a real story to tell,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said, adding, “The RAF is so privileged to be a part of her story and aviation should be forever grateful.”</p> <p>Agnes Butchkosky “Butchie” was raised in Pennsylvania. Her father was a coal miner and the family of seven managed through several labor strikes. Butchie enrolled at Kings County Hospital School of Nursing in Brooklyn, graduating in 1944. She was determined to join the Army Nurse Corps, even though she was too short. She piled her hair on top of her head which made her just tall enough. “Our generation was willing to step up and it was what I wanted to do,” she said.</p> <div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 38%"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="847" height="693" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ben-Ryan-and-P-38-Jolly-Roger.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10931 size-full" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ben-Ryan-and-P-38-Jolly-Roger.jpg 847w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ben-Ryan-and-P-38-Jolly-Roger-300x245.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ben-Ryan-and-P-38-Jolly-Roger-768x628.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"> <p class="has-normal-font-size">Butchie served on the hospital ship,&nbsp;<em>Republic</em>&nbsp;that broke down near the Panama Canal.

But silk becomes transparent if wet. Ben had ditched his P-38 after a midair, and Butchie said, “I was glad Ben’s parachute was at the bottom of Panama Gulf!” </p> </div></div> <p>When they were both discharged, Ben roughnecked on an oil well near Livingston, Montana.</p> <p>Ben then attended Stanford for a degree in Petroleum Engineering, and the couple lived near Palo Alto for three years. Butchie followed Ben as his career with Richfield Oil took him to Bakersfield, Casper, WY, Caracas, Venezuela, Los Angeles, then Anchorage where they survived the 1964 earthquake. Ben’s notable achievement was endorsing his crew that had discovered the Prudhoe Bay oil field.</p> <p>After retirement, the couple bought the quarter-section near West Glacier where Ben would carve Ryan Field from the heavy timber.</p> <p>“We settled in Montana, a place Ben had loved as a kid growing up, with trout streams and good use for his shotgun or hunting rifle.” They built a home, and it began displaying beautiful wildlife mounts, including a moose that Butchie shot.</p> <p>In 2005, the Ryans began incrementally donating their property to the RAF so the airstrip would remain a public-use recreational destination in perpetuity. By 2012, the Ryans gracefully let age lead them to a decision to move to a comfortable room at the Montana Veteran’s Home in Columbia Falls. Moving was a huge adjustment for them, but they approached it as another natural part of their life. Ben passed in 2017 after 71 years of marriage to Butchie.&nbsp;</p> <p>Everyone at the RAF wishes Butchie a happy birthday, and expresses appreciation for the Ryans’ vision and generosity.</p> ]]>

In total about 800 feet of runway was smoothed, topsoil was replaced, tilled, seeded, mulched and compacted, all by October 27.&nbsp;RAF supporter&nbsp;Mike Hintz brought up his fifth wheel camper, “which turned out to be jobsite headquarters and the all important cooking center. A major shout out to the wives who sent enough food to keep the crew fed for the entire project,” Frederick said.&nbsp;</p> <p>“We appreciate Richard and Kathy Robinson for the use of their Rainbow Lodge facilities. If not for them, this could not have happened. We cannot thank everyone enough for all that was accomplished by this huge volunteer effort,” Frederick added.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/two-hearted-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10622" width="644" height="483" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/two-hearted-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/two-hearted-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/two-hearted-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption>From L to R: Leon Everhart, Mike Hintz and Jerry Ness </figcaption></figure></div> <p>&#8220;I am both amazed at the amount of work that was done and humbled by the generosity of our volunteers,&#8221; said RAF Director Jeff Russell.&nbsp;</p> <p>The airstrip was built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Originally only about 1,600 feet long, it’s on a bluff overlooking where the Big Two Hearted River flows into Lake Superior’s rocky shoreline in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A State Forest campground was built on the shoreline, and the privately-owned Rainbow Lodge was developed to serve recreational visitors.</p> <p>In 2012, Frederick recognized the airstrip’s recreational value, and started working on reopening it. The RAF negotiated leases with both the Michigan Dep’t of Natural Resources and the Rainbow Lodge for property to lengthen the airstrip. The work was suspended when a 21,000-acre forest fire devastated the region and Rainbow Lodge.</p> <p>“We were able to reopen the extended airstrip in 2017,” Frederick said. “It’s now 2,200 feet long. It was rough and undulating as it had always been, but the State granted a license,” he added. After an aircraft incident and pilot complaints about the roughness, the State Aeronautics commission decided not to issue a license for 2020.</p> <p>The State will inspect Two Hearted airstrip to determine licensing status, after which the RAF hopes to be able to announce its reopening in 2022.</p> ]]>

The RAF will gladly shoulder our responsibilities going forward,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said.</p> <p>The document’s stated purpose is to&nbsp;extend collaborative efforts and build on the established framework for cooperation between the Parties to implement the New Mexico Airstrip Network Strategy for preserving and enhancing airstrip access, promoting aviation, and the development, management and operation of public and privately owned airstrips located within the State of New Mexico.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Negrito-overhead-looking-SW-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10614" width="544" height="362" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Negrito-overhead-looking-SW-1-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Negrito-overhead-looking-SW-1-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Negrito-overhead-looking-SW-1-1-1-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><figcaption>Negrito Airfield, New Mexico</figcaption></figure></div> <p>NMAN Facilitator Joyce Woods explains that the coalition has had success since&nbsp;2010 when the New Mexico Pilots Association (NMPA) and the RAF partnered to preserve and improve backcountry airstrips in New Mexico. It became clear that a more unified effort with partners such as the USFS, BLM, state agencies, and recreational groups such as the NM Council of Outfitters and Guides, and private landowners would lead to sustainability. The New Mexico Airstrip Network&nbsp;was formed, modeled after the Idaho Airstrip Network.&nbsp;</p> <p>NMAN partners bonded over a shared goal to increase public access to New Mexico airstrips, while conserving the environment, and the first MOU outlined the responsibilities of each partner and was signed in 2016.</p> <p>RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller said, “It has been very rewarding to be a founding member of the NMAN, and to see the progress in a tangible way over the years. This MOU encourages public land managers to say ‘YES’ on airstrip projects.”</p> <p>The 11-page renewal document has been signed by each organization and ensures this cooperation for another five years.</p> ]]>

He also provided the letter to Ward Air, Admiralty Air Service, and Alaska Seaplanes, Part 135 operators that offer transport for visitors to the USFS cabins.</p> <p>Specifically, letters were posted at these cabins:&nbsp;</p> <p>Lake Florence Cabin&nbsp;</p> <p>Lake Kathleen Cabin</p> <p>Young Lake South Cabin</p> <p>Young Lake North Cabin</p> <p>Turner Lake West Cabin</p> <p>Turner Lake East Cabin</p> <p>Lake Alexander Cabin&nbsp;</p> <p>Big Shaheen Cabin</p> <p>Little Shaheen Cabin</p> <p>Hasselborg Creek Cabin</p> <p>Jim’s Lake Cabin&nbsp;</p> <p>Sitkoh Lake East Cabin</p> <p>Patching Lake Cabin</p> <p>Tanis Mesa North Cabin</p> <p>Tanis Mesa South Cabin</p> <p>Raven Cabins&nbsp;(Situk airstrip cabins)</p> <p>Eagle Cabin (Situk airstrip cabins)</p> <p>DeFreest had obtained approval for the letter and its distribution during Zoom meetings with staff of both the Forest Service Alaska Regional Office and the Tongass Supervisor’s Office. “We discussed volunteer partnership opportunities to preserve Tongass fly-In lake cabins, also,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>To raise awareness of the threat, DeFreest and his wife Kari hosted an “Open Hangar Social” barbecue in August which drew about 30 people from Juneau who are fly-in cabin users. “We want to thank donors Nolan&nbsp;Davis,&nbsp;and Chris&nbsp;O’Brien, as well as Harris Air Service for their generous donation. AOPA and the Alaska Airmen’s Association provided information and door prizes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, DeFreest provided numerous informal condition reports to the USFS district staff after cabin visits on Juneau, Wrangell, Sitka Ranger Districts and on Admiralty Island National Monument.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on October 29, 2021</em></p> ]]>

The Amish timbers came from Montana, and skilled volunteers erected the structure, finished off with a natural stone fireplace and chimney.<br><br>It’s an ideal place to camp, with access to hiking, fishing, or floating the Kings River. Trigger Gap is one of a network of backcountry airfields in the Ozarks, not far from the metropolitan areas of Bentonville-Fayetteville.<br><br>“It’s been a partnership that [The Nature Conservancy] is as proud of as we are,” Powell added. <br><br>See the Airfield Guide for details on <strong><a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/f6ed09bf-07ec-4302-96c8-9f80743ae0c4/overview?searchQuery=trigger">Trigger Gap</a></strong> and the many other Arkansas airfields offering recreational activities.</p> <p></p> <p><em>Submitted on October 20, 2021.</em></p> <p></p> ]]>

He began flying in 1975 in Lexington, Kentucky, and for the last 16 years he and his wife Karen have lived in New Mexico.</p> <p>“At one time, I owned four airplanes,” he explains, almost apologetically. “I love the backcountry, but I also love to fly to Oshkosh every year.” He is part of the New Mexico group that gives New Mexico backcountry flying seminars there, always well attended. He wanted something faster for those flights, and for the regular flights he and Karen enjoy to and from California and Mexico, and the Dakota with the O-540 powerplant fulfills that mission. They spend five months each year in Mexico, a comfortable four-hour flight in the Dakota.</p> <p>Chet’s career is in the medicinal sciences, and he has lived in eight states to follow professional opportunity and challenges. His experiences include research and development of&nbsp;drugs&nbsp;to treat pulmonary disease, pharmaceutical lab studies and&nbsp; human clinical studies. He has been a consultant to more than 50 pharmaceutical companies. For recreation, Chet and Karen love the outdoors. They’ve trekked all over the world, and engage in various volunteer efforts locally and internationally.</p> <p>In addition to his membership in AOPA, he has always supported local EAA chapters. He joined New Mexico Pilots Association, and met RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller. “I’d heard great things about both of these organizations,” he said, and he began helping on work parties and attending backcountry fly-ins. “Ron is ‘the man’ – he helps arrange these work parties, he drives the work vehicle in, and he cooks for us,” Chet said. He summed up his appreciation by saying, “These groups combine flying, volunteering, airfield preservation, and camaraderie. The efforts are pretty rewarding. Augmenting the Forest Service here in the west and keeping airfields alive and well is very rewarding,” adding, “These groups are tolerant of different opinions – we camp together, and we get along, regardless of our different perspectives.”&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on November 9, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

Thousands of Private Use airport managers were contacted and informed of the data updating initiative and how to update their&nbsp;data. This first step was considered a success as no airports that were in active use had their status inadvertently changed. “This success can be attributed to the FAA&#8217;s outreach efforts along with those of the RAF, AOPA, and many state aviation organizations,” Russell said. However, the FAA did change the status of 154 airports to &#8220;Closed Indefinitely&#8221; for which they had not received updated information.</p> <p>In this second round of efforts, the FAA is targeting Private Use airports for which they have not gotten updated&nbsp;information for more than 10 years. “The RAF supports the FAA initiative to clean up their Private Use airport database and we are excited to be collaborating and helping with the effort,” Russell said.</p> <p>“We are publicizing this current round of data gathering, urging owners to update their data,” Russell said, adding, “If they need help, their RAF State Liaison may be able to assist.&#8221;<br></p> <p>To update your facility’s information or register your facility, use the FAA’s Airport Data and Information Portal (ADIP) website at:&nbsp;<a href="https://adip.faa.gov/agis/public/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://adip.faa.gov/agis/public/</a>. You’ll register for an account in ADIP and follow the instructions. After the FAA reviews and approves the project, your private facility will be included on the FAA’s active airfield list for another three years.&nbsp;</p> <p>To avoid the risk of losing your listing, please take a moment to provide the required data.

This beautiful airstrip provides pilots an opportunity to enjoy spectacular coastal scenery and easy beach access for recreational opportunities. The RAF signed a lease with the airstrip owners, Big Creek Timber Co., to ensure ongoing maintenance and preservation for public use.</p> <p>Bud McCrary created the strip from which to fly his 1964 Skylane. During summer evenings, Bud flew over the Santa Cruz Mountains checking for forest fire smoke. The California Forestry Association memorialized Mr. McCrary as a giant in the forestry sector, a “pioneer of sustainable forestry, a champion of community trails, and inventor of mechanical solutions.”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0236-edited.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10246" width="512" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0236-edited.jpeg 984w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0236-edited-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_0236-edited-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /><figcaption>Bud McCrary</figcaption></figure></div> <p>Bud invented his own VASI at the short airstrip to make it safer for him to land. With Bud’s passing and the airstrip seeing less use over recent years the question was what would become of the airstrip. The RAF along with dedicated local pilots started a conversation with the McCrary family to preserve the airstrip and Bud’s legacy.</p> <p>“As a respected national organization with a track record of preserving airstrips across the country, the RAF built a relationship with the owners. They appreciated our intention to preserve the airstrip and be good stewards of the property,” said RAF Director Tim Riley.</p> <p>Led by local RAF volunteers Jeremy Lezin and Barry Porter, the airstrip has already been improved. Encroaching vegetation has been removed, the 900-foot strip has been graded, and a picnic table, barbecue grill and portable toilet have been installed. Camping is permitted on the field.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to put into words how beautiful this location is…stunning and magnificent come to mind as you exit the plane and look out across the expanse of the Pacific,” said RAF President Bill McGlynn. “We can&#8217;t thank the McCrary family enough for this personal commitment to preserving this airfield and its history for the future.&#8221;</p> <p>The RAF recently celebrated its new relationship with the McCrary family and the revitalization of the airstrip at a lunch on the field. Family members and pilots shared memories of Bud. His 93-year-old brother Lud recounted the time that he spotted a wounded fisherman in distress from his office window. They radioed for help and Bud flew his Skylane off the strip to direct the Coast Guard to the fisherman and his life was saved.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed-7-edited-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10250" width="648" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed-7-edited-1.jpg 1006w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed-7-edited-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed-7-edited-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /></figure></div> <p>Riley noted that “anything that flies is welcome to use the strip.” Over the years, it has been used by hang gliders, Army Blackhawk helicopters, air ambulances, search and rescue aircraft, and those practicing short field techniques. He also noted the prevalence of strong crosswinds. A safety briefing is required prior to use.</p> <p>More information and the required safety briefing is available on the <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;AEdHyLWFQzlbhxErOYaG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide.</a></p> <p>A history of Big Creek Lumber is here: <a href="https://bigcreeklumber.com/past-and-present/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://bigcreeklumber.com/past-and-present/</a></p> <p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation was founded in 2003.

The water system was winterized, and the grounds that were disturbed during construction were prepared for grass seeding. Skilled volunteers worked on barn lighting and plumbing, and the pilot shelter and bear boxes were cleaned.</p> <p>With cool evening temperatures, everyone enjoyed the warmth of the wood stove.</p> <p>The public is welcome to continue using Ryan Field as long as weather permits, with prior receipt of the <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;mjqAbbiZkScPiMjpdHTE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety briefing</a> available on the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/c3826db1-a327-420c-89b2-8f04721148b5/overview?searchQuery=ryan+field">Airfield Guide</a> website.</p> <div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"> <div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%"> <div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-8 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"> <div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lynn-Mareth-Perkins.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10040" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lynn-Mareth-Perkins.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lynn-Mareth-Perkins-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lynn-Mareth-Perkins-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">RAF Supporter Lynn Mareth Perkins</figcaption></figure> </div> </div> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Gibney-Joe-Feiler.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10041" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Gibney-Joe-Feiler.jpg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Gibney-Joe-Feiler-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Mike-Gibney-Joe-Feiler-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roof work at the Ryan Barn</figcaption></figure> </div> </div> ]]>

The law stated, “. . . a person may not operate a motor vehicle in or on a protected freshwater area on or after January 1, 2004.” Texas is the second largest state by area, but only five percent of its land is public, including navigable streams and the vast bays and Gulf coast. “Each are treasured by recreational and outdoor enthusiasts, and the demand to experience their beauty has only increased over the last two years,” Jeff Miller, Senior Advisor for Texas State Representative John Cyrier said. When landowners complained about aircraft landing on the gravel bars and riverbeds near their property, Texas Parks and Wildlife Game Wardens began issuing warnings to pilots who had been landing in these areas for years.&nbsp;</p> <p>In order to clarify the unintended consequences of the 2003 law, Clinton began working with his friend John Cyrier – also an RAF supporter – on a fix that would reauthorize this established practice. &#8220;The outdoors and aviation are two of my greatest passions, and this bill quickly became one of my top priorities for the session, Representative Cyrier said.</p> <p>Clinton testified in the House&nbsp;committee, saying, &#8220;Planes that have the capability to land and takeoff in riverbeds are arguably some of the least impactful vehicles that utilize the river.” He pointed out that large tires don’t disturb the surface, the distance required is minimal, and the likelihood of operations after dark is slim to none.&nbsp;“We pilots enjoy the outdoors as much as anglers, boaters, hikers, and campers, and want to share the great state of Texas’s natural resources,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks in part to Clinton’s efforts, Representative Cyrier and Senator Charles Perry were able to pass&nbsp;<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/HB04436F.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HB 4436</a>&nbsp;in June, allowing the operation of an aircraft in or on a protected freshwater area in spite of pushback from local landowners. “After working with Texas Parks and Wildlife and successfully passing the bill, Texas riverbeds are open again for recreational aviation,” Miller announced.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rep-John-Cyrier.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10034" width="681" height="387" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rep-John-Cyrier.jpeg 1000w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rep-John-Cyrier-300x170.jpeg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rep-John-Cyrier-768x436.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></figure></div> <p>“I&#8217;m glad we could get it across the goal line for the recreational aviation community,” Representative Cyrier said.</p> <p>“Now it’s important for pilots to be aware of the need&nbsp;to promote flying safely, get proper training, and not be a nuisance to adjacent land owners while they land on sandbars,” Clinton said.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 30, 2021</em></p> ]]>

The field lies in an area popular for recreation and the summer farm market. “There is world class fishing on the Ausable river and local outfitters are within a mile for your needs, as well as guides. There are many trailheads to the mountains in the area,” RAF New York Liaison Doug Turnbull said. He was concerned about the potential for aircraft and vehicle or pedestrian encounters on and near the runway. He used&nbsp;an&nbsp;RAF grant&nbsp;award&nbsp;to purchase durable aluminum signs that have been posted along the runway to protect users. Town of Keene workers installed the signs.</p> <p>“The project with the signs came out better than well – it came out great,” Assistant Airport Manager Bob Rose said.&nbsp;“You are a fantastic organization and you have done a lot for Marcy Field, “ Rose added.</p> <p>In 2020 an RAF grant was used to remove encroaching trees and brush. The Town provided equipment and manpower, and Adirondack Aviators volunteers helped accomplish the work. &nbsp;</p> <p>“This greatly enhances the RAF mission by improving safety at Marcy Field,” Turnbull said.</p> <p>Find details about Marcy Field in the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/2144a097-2213-47a2-9ec2-a73dc1bbab1d/overview?searchQuery=marcy">Airfield.Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 27, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

MPA volunteers have historically assisted the Forest Service on maintenance chores at Schafer, and the RAF joined in the effort.</p> <p>Pete Smith of Lewistown, MT had completely refurbished a horse-drawn mower and disassembled it so it could be flown to Schafer from Lewistown. Prior to the work party scheduled in July, Newpower flew in the center section, both wheels and the seat after picking them up from Smith in Lewistown. On&nbsp;the morning of September 3, Marc McKee, Montana Aeronautics Chief of Airports and Airways flew to Lewistown and he and Smith loaded the remaining components in their two planes for the delivery flights. Volunteers including USFS Schafer Station Guard Jeremy Rust reassembled the mower.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kal Kovatch of Roundwood West in Seeley Lake and pilot Mike Lindemer, also of Seeley, had built a new gate of raw wood stock Kovatch had donated.

Perfect weather enabled 37 planes and 56 folks to attend.

Pierson agreed to allow a work&nbsp;party, and RAF and New Mexico Pilots Association volunteers began work in preparation for fly-ins, which the Ranger also approved. “A year or two later, we installed a fire ring, camping area, tie-downs, and we repaired the tetrahedron and installed a second windsock.” RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller said.</p> <p>Pierson invited the RAF and NMPA to USFS Forest Leadership Team meetings, where&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;made a presentation on their future goals for the Gila Airstrips. The New Mexico Airstrip Network team had created the Gila Airstrips Integrated Operations and Maintenance Plan and presented it to the USFS.</p> <p>In 2018, 33 RAF/NMPA volunteers had a work party at Negrito to rebuild a mile and-a-half of fence, and paint runway markers. Ranger Pierson joined in the efforts.</p> <p>In 2019, Pierson approved and facilitated the installation of a vault toilet for Negrito, provided with grants from both the RAF and NMPA. “The following year, RAF and NMPA volunteers poured a concrete access with John&#8217;s staff providing assistance and oversight,” Keller said.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RAF-members-at-2021-Gila-Fly-in--768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9965" width="354" height="472" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RAF-members-at-2021-Gila-Fly-in--768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RAF-members-at-2021-Gila-Fly-in--225x300.jpg 225w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RAF-members-at-2021-Gila-Fly-in-.jpg 810w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></figure></div> <p>Pierson also approved the volunteers’ plan to rehabilitate and reopen Rainy Mesa airstrip, NM54 after 45 years of dormancy. This project triggered a 2021 appropriation of $25,000 for gravel for Rainy Mesa and Negrito, and a new concrete picnic table, shade structure material, and kiosk for Negrito. “All of this was done while John was Incident Commander for wildland fires, requiring him to be called away often,” Keller added.</p> <p>“John will be sorely missed as Reserve District Ranger, but he is staying in the area and has expressed an interest in staying involved with recreational aviation,” Keller said.</p> <p>RAF Chairman John McKenna said, &#8220;Thanks to this foundation of cooperation, the RAF anticipates continuing success in partnering with NMPA, the New Mexico Airstrip Network, and with Gila National Forest’s management team.&#8221;</p> <p><em>Submitted on September</em> 21, 2021.</p> ]]>

Chris trained at Central Maine Aviation in Pittsfield with owner/instructor and RAF supporter Charlie Surprenant. Within a month, “I did something really stupid and bought a 1969 Piper Cherokee 160 so I didn&#8217;t have to rent a plane,” he said. He solo’ed on July 3.</p> <p>So, why not fly to Texas for the National STOL competition with another new pilot? Texas in November is pretty nice compared to Maine. “It was a trip that we won&#8217;t forget. The weather wasn&#8217;t playing nice.” It took the two VFR pilots 21 hours to get there, and 15 hours&nbsp;and five days to get home. “We met great people. Huge shoutout to Barbara Maxwell at the Perryville, Missouri Airport for the hospitality and awesome crew quarters where we stayed.“</p> <p>Just six months later, Chris explains, “I did another stupid thing and bought a 1942 Aeronca Super Chief on floats before getting my seaplane rating,” and he discovered the amazing experience of float flying in Maine. He claims there are “way more places to land on water and eat than there are at airfields!” He logged 50 hours of float time in the old Chief before embarking on the project to rebuild its wood and fabric wings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chris received spin and aerobatic training, and is working to complete his commercial and instrument ratings. Chris plans to build a Cessna L-19 Bird Dog with&nbsp;friend&nbsp;Steve Noyes. With hydraulic wheel skis and floats, and 540 Lycoming, “I’ll be able to explore backcountry&nbsp;places AND they will stop making fun of me for bringing my Cherokee,” he says.</p> <p>In addition to fun flying, Chris has discovered a way to fly for community service. He participated in “Wings for Wishes” to benefit the Make A Wish foundation serving children with life changing illnesses. “Together with a great group of pilots and the public, we raised $28,000 to make wishes come true for at least four of these children.” He anticipates even bigger results next year.</p> <p>When the Dover-Foxcroft town manager announced that Charles A. Chase Jr Memorial Airport’s beautiful 3,000-ft grass runway would be closed to install a solar farm, Chris knew the community would never get its airfield back once it was gone. He helped create a Facebook page, “Save the Charles A. Chase Memorial Airport” that gathered huge community support. RAF Maine Liaisons Steve Mason and Andy Rowe offered to help. On a cold snowy night, RAF Massachusetts Liaison Rene Robillard and New Hampshire Liaison John Meade made the normally four hour drive – on a good day – joining Steve Mason to speak at a town meeting prior to the final vote.&nbsp;“The RAF was instrumental in the fight to save our airport,” Chris states.</p> <p>“With additional help from AOPA, Maine Center for Classic Aviation, Maine Aviation Association, countless pilots, the people of Dover-Foxcroft,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the family of Charles A Chase Jr., we were able to change the&nbsp;Facebook page to “SAVED the Charles A Chase Memorial Airport,” he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He reports lots of new activity at his beloved 44B. More GA traffic, new hangars, fly-ins and STOL competitions are in the works. There are plans to build a new pilot building, camping sites, fire pits and covered picnic areas. He said, “I would like to thank the RAF for myself, and on behalf of the Chase family for all their help keeping aviation alive in our community!”</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 10, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

They are welcome as long as they need it.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Annie said, “There is really no way to describe the amazing relief that we feel at being able to leave New Orleans after the storm, and how grateful we are to Steve and Libby. It is an incredible act of generosity to let a stranger (with kids, a dog, and a cat) stay at your home, and speaks volumes about their incredible compassion.” She pointed out that Maus’s had previously provided shelter to strangers after Hurricane Katrina.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Although I am not a pilot myself, we have certainly benefited from this amazing community,” she added.</p> <p><em>Submitted on September 8, 2018.</em></p> ]]>

RAF Virginia Liaison Alan White reports that since 1931, locals have traveled to the top of the mountain for the cooler temperatures, beautiful vistas and nighttime star gazing. As with other bygone attractions, the activities faded with time. Pilots still camped at Ingalls occasionally but the airport was looking to enhance this aspect.</p> <p>There are two camping areas with picnic tables and fire rings, 24 hour access to restroom and showers, a courtesy car, and avgas. Popular hikes are the Nature Conservancy Warm Springs Mountain Preserve Trails and the Homestead Skyline Drive. It is a Dark Sky area, yet only a few miles from a five-star resort. But with few employees and such a large area to maintain, the airport was not able revive the trail to a scenic outlook and loop around the small knoll. White approached them about ways the RAF could help.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsFieldWorkParty2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9714" width="397" height="298" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsFieldWorkParty2.jpg 904w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsFieldWorkParty2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsFieldWorkParty2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /><figcaption><strong>RAF volunteers helped clear trails around Ingalls<br>Airport&#8217;s scenic loop and outlook on July 31.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>White and RAF Virginia Ambassador Jeremy Vaughan organized a group to clear the trails on Saturday, July 31. “The airport shares the mountain top with the Nature Conservancy and a few days prior to the work event, The Nature Conservancy actually went in with a bush hog and took out a lot of the big stuff,” White reported. His group trimmed encroaching limbs and cleared the overlook. “Since they had done some prep work, we were able to extend our scope and work on trails well past where we had anticipated stopping,” he added. RAF volunteers were able to clear half of the loop as well.</p> <p><em>AOPA Live</em>&nbsp;producer Paul Harrop stayed with the work crew all day, filming and interviewing the volunteers. “Paul got into the spirit so much that he himself could be seen clearing brush from the trails before the day was over!” White added. After a hard day, several volunteers enjoyed the camping facilities and a few others arrived that were unable to make it earlier in the day.&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsWorkParty-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9715" width="388" height="218" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsWorkParty-1.jpg 904w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsWorkParty-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IngallsWorkParty-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><figcaption><strong>The RAF volunteer work party completed maintenance July 31 on hiking trails surrounding Ingalls Airport.

Camping usage has increased from an occasional camper to people there almost every weekend, and many more land to hike the trails. “The staff at Ingalls made a special point to come out and thank the RAF, not only for the work we had just completed, but for reinvigorating their airport,” White said, adding, “They contribute this all to the work and publicity that the RAF has done on their behalf.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on August 9, 2021.</em><br>Photos courtesy of Jeremy Vaughan.</p> ]]>

Thanks to the efforts of RAF Oregon Ambassador Bill Ables, the USFS directed a portion of this year’s federally allocated funds to initiate improvements, including purchase of a new all-weather picnic table and RAF fire ring that were shipped to Mayes. Several RAF supporters and Oregon Pilot&#8217;s Association members gathered at Toketee in early August to clean up the camping area and install the table and fire ring. In addition, RAF member Pete Gauthier had constructed and donated a beautiful timber picnic table the crew helped&nbsp;install.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RAF-Toketee-Fire-Pit-.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9762" width="367" height="275" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RAF-Toketee-Fire-Pit-.jpg 902w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RAF-Toketee-Fire-Pit--300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RAF-Toketee-Fire-Pit--768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" /><figcaption><strong>A new RAF fire pit is installed in the campground.</strong></figcaption></figure></div> <p>At the time the volunteers were working, the airfield was occupied by a large USFS Hot-Shot crew that had been fighting&nbsp;a nearby wildfire&nbsp;for more than eight weeks. The fire camp manager was very welcoming and stated that she was “impressed that volunteers from the pilot community took an interest in the condition of the airfield and were willing to donate their time and efforts to maintaining the facility.”</p> <p>Mayes noted that further improvements to the primitive camping area are under discussion. Provision of a toilet would be greatly appreciated by the users.

The effort began with the shipment of the crated mower to Ables in Enterprise, OR. “The Forest Service happened to be conducting some helicopter training, and agreed to help us get the mower into the airstrip,” Ables said. “Within sixteen minutes, it went from the bed of my pickup to Red’s.&#8221; Mike and Jerry Rahn, Jim Akenson, Greg Bales, and Ables assembled the mower.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wallowa-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9790" width="397" height="297" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wallowa-1.jpg 901w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wallowa-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wallowa-1-768x575.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></figure></div> <p>Head mule skinner Holly Akenson completed the mowing behind Bird and Bat, the experienced mule team that had pulled the obsolete mower. Hanley Jenkins assisted in the case of a “plug up” which never happened, according to Ables.</p> <p>The new mower and shipping cost $11,000, paid for by US Forest Service Region 6 funding. An additional $1,000 was provided for Akensons’ use of the mules for mowing. These resources are a result of the continuing cost-sharing program the RAF has established with the US Forest Service.&nbsp;</p> <p>RAF President Bill McGlynn commented. “Nicely done, Bill and Richard. This is a great example that we can use with other National Forests.”</p> <p>The RAF thanks each volunteer, and Forest Service District Ranger&nbsp;Brian Anderson&nbsp;for helping facilitate the maintenance at Red’s.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Nearby Weather Station</strong></p> <p>Just a half mile north of Red’s Wallowa Horse Ranch is privately owned Minam Lodge (7OR0) airstrip.

The new equipment was also purchased with USFS monies. The volunteers helped throughout the multi-day project by flying equipment and people to the site as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The solar panels, cameras, and weather station are in place awaiting final wi-fi connection, possibly by mid-September. “We will send the link to the various pilot organizations so everyone can access the cameras and weather info for the Minam River canyon,” Ables said. The RAF thanks Barnes Ellis, owner of Minam Lodge, who has been very supportive of this effort, and will also have the link on his website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minam-lodge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.minam-lodge.com</a>&nbsp;when it is available.</p> <p><em>Submitted on August 23, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

Chip wrote the software and Dave began leading a small group of pilots to identify local airstrip characteristics and the Airfield Guide began. Additionally&nbsp;<em>Fly OZ,&nbsp;</em>the interactive listing of 64 appealing backcountry airfields in the Ozarks has continued to expand within the Guide. “Refining as we went, amenities and search functions evolved as we added strips,” Powell added.&nbsp;</p> <p>The RAF was impressed with their results and a partnership formed that mutually recognized the demand for a national directory of fun places to fly. The RAF’s network of state liaisons are tasked with surveying airfields with recreational opportunities for inclusion in the Airfield Guide.</p> <p>Want to raft the Kings River in Arkansas? Consider landing at Trigger Gap, where local river guides will take care of you. A new pavilion is in the camping area to enhance your stay at the scenic airfield.&nbsp;Land and camp at Goodspeed Airport in East Haddam, CT, and stroll to the Opera House for an award-winning live show, or watch the historic swing bridge.&nbsp;Maybe you seek a real remote backcountry flying destination like Jake’s Bar along the Chitina River in Alaska’s Wrangell-St. Elias National Park.&nbsp;When the morning mist burns off, land at Half Moon Bay in California’s central coast, where the Pacific surf is just a short hike away.</p> <p>Many Airfield listings include photos, and some include videos of approaches and landings. The Guide includes public and private airfields and defines them as either Permissive (green), where users don’t need to ask for permission; and Conditional (yellow), where a condition needs to be met before use, such as a required Safety Briefing or prior contact with owner.</p> <p>Once you’ve created a user registration at&nbsp;<a href="http://airfield.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">airfield.guide</a>, you’ll receive updates of the new fields as they are added.</p> <p>The “Manage Tour” feature can be used to plan a flight of several locations, upload it to ForeFlight®, and email it to fellow pilots.</p> <p>Users will find basic details like lat/long, elevation, ownership, pattern direction, runway length, and CTAF to help make aviation decisions. You can sort by recreational amenities (camping, restrooms, fishing, cell service, etc), region, state, or runway length. RHI, (Relative Hazard Index) is included, based on Galen Hanselman’s rating system to help you assess your, and your aircraft’s suitability.&nbsp;<strong><em>The Airfield.Guide is also where you’ll find important Safety Briefings, some of which are required to be reviewed prior to landing</em></strong></p> <p><em>by Carmine Mowbray<br>Submitted August 19, 2021</em></p> ]]>

And now the sign “The RAF Proudly Supports This Airstrip” can go up at the field, thanks to RAF Director Bill Brine and New Hampshire Liaison John Meade.</p> <p>By an overwhelming voice vote, Town Meeting members authorized funding to replace a dilapidated World War II hangar at Katama, (1B2) for local groups to engage in aviation projects year-round. But the Town could not allocate enough to provide for heating the hangar, so local supporters and the RAF stepped in with resources.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9363" width="390" height="293" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama2.jpg 800w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></figure></div> <p>“We have an RAF member who is an expert at heating big spaces,” Brine said. “A quick call to John Meade was all that was needed.&#8221; John’s company, [Preferred Mechanical Services] donated the engineering on behalf of the RAF, and sold the needed equipment to the Trust at trade cost. “Without the help of the RAF and John Meade, the new hangar would sit without heat and idle during the long gray winters on Martha’s Vineyard,” Brine explained, adding, “Our dream is to have young islanders involved with aviation during the winter months.”</p> <p>The Trust formed years ago to provide support to both the Town of Edgartown and The Nature Conservancy to preserve the airfield’s economic and ecological benefits. The Trust website explains:&nbsp;</p> <p>“Residents of Edgartown benefit from having a historic grass airfield that is relatively low impact and is considered one of the most ecologically significant natural areas in Massachusetts.”</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9364" width="386" height="290" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama3.jpg 800w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Katama3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></figure></div> <p>Pilots as well love this airfield. The longest of its three turf runways is 3,700 feet at a field elevation of eighteen feet. It dates back to 1924 and was used by the Curtis Wright Corporation. The airfield has direct access to the ocean beach and is a popular place to swim in the Atlantic. “The seasonal restaurant is always fantastic,” Meade says, and on nice days, a person might have a chance to take a ride in one of two barnstorming Waco biplanes hangared at the field. “The airport’s future is protected by its conservation trust,” Meade explained, and this project had to reflect the spirit of its long history.</p> <p>Brine, a native New Englander and resident of Martha’s Vineyard says, “Katama is often mispronounced. Most Islanders pronounce it&nbsp;<em>ka-TAY-ma</em>. Those from the mainland sometimes call it&nbsp;<em>KA-tama</em>. No matter how you pronounce Katama on the unicom, you will be welcomed with open arms.”</p> <p><em>Submitted on June 24, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

It provides access to the McKenzie River, mountain bike trails, and remote camping. “Following the inspirational example set by the long term commitment of Oregon Pilot Association and RAF members Paul and Rob&nbsp;in Ehrhardt, volunteers have been instrumental in maintaining and improving the McKenzie Bridge airport,” RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes said. “Our efforts have been acknowledged by both the Oregon Department of Aviation and the US Forest Service. The positive outcomes at McKenzie Bridge demonstrate how collaboration between the RAF and public land managers can benefit the recreational aviation community,” he added.</p> <p>For the past three years Mayes has organized at least two volunteer work parties each year to perform maintenance and safety improvements at the airport. To support these efforts, Mayes was awarded an RAF grant to mow and undertake improvements to the airfield.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1008" height="756" src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-03_08.29.30_1_50_1_50.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9661" srcset="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-03_08.29.30_1_50_1_50.jpg 1008w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-03_08.29.30_1_50_1_50-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-03_08.29.30_1_50_1_50-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></figure></div> <p>Oregon RAF volunteers began this year’s efforts in June. Using funds from the RAF grant, they rented a tractor and mower to mow the airfield, and used string trimmers to clear the tie-downs. The state-owned airport lies within the Willamette National Forest, and the USFS used a portion of this year’s federally-allocated funds to provide additional improvements. A new picnic table and RAF fire ring supplied by the USFS were assembled and installed by volunteers Jim Campbell, Ed Stryker, Jeff Thompson, Todd Colver, and Kent Couch.</p> <p>Discussions are ongoing with the USFS to construct an improved camping area on the southeast side of the runway. See the airfield.guide for more information on McKenzie Bridge State Airport.</p> <p><strong><em>See NOTAMS for TFR’s in the region&nbsp;due to fire fighting activity, and forest airstrip closures due to high risk.</em></strong></p> <p><em>Submitted on July22, 2021.</em></p> ]]>

Chris explains that back in the early sixties, Greenville was still a sleepylittle Southern town.&#8230; ]]>

</w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--></p> <p>A lifelong resident of Greenville County, South Carolina, Chris Sullivan started flying in 1991 largely inspired by his Uncle John who had been a Marine Corps fighter pilot in the Pacific theater, and later flew a Mooney for business.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p> </p> <p>Chris explains that back in the early sixties, Greenville was still a sleepy<br />little Southern town. When his Uncle John’s business travel brought him close,<br />he would buzz the house. “Momma would say, ‘There’s John,’ and we would all<br />pile in the car and drive out to the airport to meet him. For most of my<br />childhood I called all airplanes ‘John,’” Chris said.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Chris currently serves with the local Civil Air Patrol squadron, and is on<br />the leadership team for the local Upstate Aviation Club which hosts monthly<br />social affairs.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>While researching the Royal Air Force online, Chris discovered the<br />Recreational Aviation Foundation. At first, it seemed to him that there isn’t a<br />lot of “backcountry” flying in South Carolina, especially after having spent<br />several weeks flying to Alaska and down the coast of Oregon and California. He<br />made what he calls “a modest contribution” to the RAF because, “it was<br />something that needs to be protected,” he said.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>“I had the opportunity to get more directly involved with the RAF project at<br />Creighton Island, Georgia. I started to realize that perhaps the world of<br />backcountry flying was bigger than I realized,” he says, adding, “South<br />Carolina is experiencing an accelerating development boom, which makes<br />protecting what we have even more important.”</p> <p><a href="mailto:csullivan@theraf.org">csullivan@theraf.org</a><br />864-660-9188</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> ]]>

Locals have expressed concern about the potential for planes hitting cars or pedestrians on the runway. “This seems to be an issue especially on Sunday when the farm market is open. A lot of hikers park along the street and runway,” said New York Liaison Doug Turnbull.</p> <p>Turnbull is using the grant to purchase ten durable aluminum signs to be posted along the runway to protect against vehicle and pedestrian encounters. Assistant Airport Manager Bob Rose confirmed that the Town of Keene will provide stakes and complete the sign installation. This is the second successful cooperative project between the RAF and the Town of Keene. In 2020 an RAF grant was awarded to remove encroaching trees and brush. The Town provided equipment and manpower, and local volunteers known as the Adirondack Aviators Group helped accomplish the work.</p> <p>Turnbull is motivated to complete the sign project by mid-July, when summer traffic is heaviest.</p> <p>Find details about Marcy Field in the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/2144a097-2213-47a2-9ec2-a73dc1bbab1d/overview?searchQuery=marcy">Airfield Guide</a>.</p> ]]>
