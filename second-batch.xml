<p>The bars, brothels and hospital, school, and gymnasium are long gone in what was&nbsp;formerly the bustling town&nbsp;of McCarthy, Alaska,&nbsp;at the foot of the Wrangell mountains&nbsp;adjacent to the Kennecott mine, but its history is intact. And now, just across a footbridge, a series of “wayside” panels commemorate the many miners who lost their lives in the&nbsp;dangerous pursuit of underground copper mining for Kennicott Copper Mining Company, now the Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark.</p>



<p>RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton, a longtime member of&nbsp;Pioneers&nbsp;of Alaska, had participated in the panel installations, and gathered with members of the&nbsp;Pioneers, the Flying Rotarians, local community members, and representatives of the National Park Service for the June 19 dedication ceremony, co-hosted by the&nbsp;Pioneers&nbsp;of Alaska and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.</p>



<p>That same weekend, Clayton hosted the Fifth Annual Aviators/Pioneers&nbsp;of Alaska Expedition, a June 19-20 fly-in at his Fireweed airstrip (OAK8), eight miles southwest of Kennicott, which served as the camping place for the group. An estimated 100 people attended with 25 aircraft and other vehicles.&nbsp; “The day really never ends on Summer Solstice weekend in McCarthy, so I could not accurately keep track of the number of people coming and going,” said Clayton.&nbsp; “</p>



<p>RAF,&nbsp;Pioneers, International Fellowship of Flying Rotarians and EAA Chapter 42 volunteers flew out Sunday for a work party ten miles southeast at May Creek airstrip (MYK).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten planes with eighteen volunteers descended into historic May Creek, with weed whackers, limb loppers and other tools to clear brush from the approach at the southern end of the airstrip, around the “mail shack” and around the overgrown tie down area.&nbsp;The airstrip features a National Park Service public use cabin available at no cost on a first-come first-served basis and provides access to a host of recreational opportunities, including biking and hiking a network of roads, and access to the Nizina River for rafting.</p>

<p>On Saturday, May 29 approximately 20 people representing the RAF, Montana Pilots Association, and Montana Aeronautics helped maintain Spotted&nbsp;Bear&nbsp;Forest Service airstrip, (8U4) along the South Fork of the Flathead River, just south of Hungry Horse Reservoir in northwest Montana. RAF Montana Liaison Scott Newpower reported that most drove in and camped. A few flew in, including MPA President Mike Vivion. “Montana Aeronautics Bureau Chief Marc McKee flew in with his father, and we wish to thank Aeronautics for the many years of partnership on these airstrips,” Newpower said.</p>



<p>Newpower, McKee, Vivion and other MPA and RAF volunteers met informally with District Ranger Scott Snelson for an update on maintenance and development in the Forest District.&nbsp;The group realigned runway cones, replaced windsocks and repaired the windsock standards. They cleaned and painted the outhouse and runway marker and installed a new shed roof. MPA Western Vice President Perry Brown grilled burgers for the group.</p>



<p>This year’s MPA work party at Meadow Creek, (0S1) drew 25 folks from many parts of Montana and as far away as the Keystone State. RAF and Montana Pilots Association volunteers flew in, enjoying ideal weather. RAF Pennsylvania Liaison Andy Turner had flown in with his two boys and set aside plans for a day hike to participate. The boys took turns mowing the entire field and parking areas, logging about six hours on the mower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Volunteers weed whacked around cones and picnic tables. Both windsocks were replaced, and gopher holes were filled. Lots of downed trees were cut up and removed, and walking trails were cleared. Ry Keller from the Kalispell EAA chapter provided and cooked a steak lunch, as has become his much-appreciated tradition.&nbsp;</p>]]>

<p>Early Saturday, Newpower, McKee, Vivion and other MPA and RAF volunteers met informally with Spotted Bear District Ranger Scott Snelson for an update on maintenance and development in the Forest District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group completed realigning the runway cones, replacing windsocks and repairing the windsock standards. They cleaned and painted the outhouse and the concrete runway end “T”. They installed a new roof on a storage shed.</p>



<p>After the work party, RAF member and MPA Western Vice President Perry Brown from Columbia Falls, Montana cooked burgers on the grill.</p>

<p>Approaching Ryan Field at pattern altitude the weekend of June 12-13, the place looked verdant and ready for mowing. As RAF Director Mike Perkins cut big swaths with the John Deere tractor, Mike and Nancy Hines mounted their pair of John Deere mowers, and expertly steered around cones, trees, tents, and tight places to finish the job on the runway and surrounding areas.<br>
<br>In all, 26 folks helped get Ryan Field, the pilot shelter, bear boxes, cabins, and grounds ready for the June 26-27 Fly-In and summer flying season. <em>
<strong>Please note: as of 6/23/21, Ryan Field fly-in registration is now full.</strong>
</em>
<br> <br>A crew assembled jack leg fence to keep vehicles off the runway, and chainsaws could be heard cutting trees that threatened the power line.<br> <br>Workers did shifts at the business end of the log splitter and stacked several cords of firewood for summer use. The wood cookstove in the shelter rarely cooled off and a kitchen crew served hot lunch both days, and had hot water and snacks ready throughout the day.<br> <br>The two cabins were occupied and were a welcome refuge from Friday night’s heavy rain.<br>RAF Pennsylvania Liaison Andy Turner and his two boys came the farthest, and when the task to replace the windsock on top of the vintage drill rig came up, son Josh readily volunteered to do the work. <br> <br>Volunteers had sealed the concrete barn floor recently but its interior is still under construction, with finish work remaining to be done.<br>

<p>Tim Riley has devoted many volunteer hours organizing and assisting on airstrip improvements in Idaho and Montana. He has also worked closely with the US Forest Service to foster cooperation and support RAF goals on public lands across the country.<br>Riley is a native of upstate New York. His introduction to aviation was as a youngster in a Beaver on floats on the lakes in the Adirondacks. He has lived and traveled around the world during a career in the data networking and security industry.</p>




<p>Starting with hang gliders and paragliders, Tim has flown foot-launched gliders thousands of miles across California, Nevada, and the Western US. “You never knew where the day was going to end, but it was guaranteed to be an adventure. You might even share a few thermals with a condor or hawk along the way,” he says.</p>



<p>As his kids grew, Tim switched to airplanes to share the joy of flying with his family, accumulating over 30 years of recreational flying experience. “From Baja to the Florida Everglades, from Mount Rushmore to Niagara Falls, recreational aviation is an incredible way to see the country,” he says. Tim’s additional aviation pursuits included owning a flight school and maintenance shop, providing flight instruction, and selling new and used aircraft. Tim has served on the Driggs Airport Board and currently volunteers to fly animal rescue flights.</p>



<p>Tim and his wife Janette – also a rated pilot – are based in Driggs, Idaho. The couple enjoys hiking, kayaking, skiing, and especially backcountry flying and camping.</p>



<p>“By far, over the years, the best thing about flying has been the incredible number of kind and generous people we’ve met,” Tim says, adding, “the RAF is the epitome of this flying and family spirit. It is a privilege to work with such a group on preserving access for everyone to enjoy.”</p>

<p>Trigger Gap airfield, (17A) is now a premier backcountry airfield. Volunteers have added a fire ring, an outhouse, and picnic tables. It’s just 29 nm east of Thaden Field (VBT), which serves Bentonville, and pilots from all over the country have enjoyed this special place. Campers at Trigger Gap enjoy a great view over the Kings River, famous for smallmouth bass fishing. “Trigger Gap offers a beautiful recreational flying destination for both experienced pilots and those new to this kind of flying,” says Dave Powell, Arkansas Liaison.</p>

<p>Barrows Field (VA04) is an RAF supported grass airfield near Roanoke, VA in the Shenandoah Valley along the Catawba Creek.&nbsp;Barrows is home to R&amp;B Aircraft, makers of Bearhawk aircraft.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Barrows-Field4.jpg">


<p>To make the field more of a recreational destination with amenities, owner Bob Barrows requested a little help from the RAF. RAF Virginia Liaison Alan White surveyed the needs and was awarded an RAF grant to take on the project. A work party was held at the airfield over Mother’s Day weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wind kept volunteers from flying into Barrows Field but that didn’t stop over a dozen folks from showing up and pitching in.&nbsp;“We accomplished all of the planned activities,” White reported, and “A special thanks goes to EAA Chapter 1031 out of Winchester for their great support of this project,” he added.</p>



<p>Workers felled trees that were encroaching on the approach. They developed a camping area adjacent to the river, and installed an RAF fire ring. They assembled a picnic table, blazed a new river walk trail from the campground to the existing hiking trail and cleared downed trees from the trails. The group installed signs pointing out the campground and trails.&nbsp;“We all ate lunch at our new picnic table,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Barrows-Field3.jpg">


<p>“The finishing touch after any major accomplishment is to raise the victory flag and that’s just what we did,” White said, adding, “An official RAF windsock was installed and now flies proudly over Barrows Field.”</p>



<p>Seven of the crew decided they “had to give the new campground a proper initiation” and pitched their tents.&nbsp;John Ely barbecued burgers, hotdogs and brats with sauerkraut and chili. After dinner the campers enjoyed sitting around the new RAF fire ring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RAF cooperates with New Mexico Pilots Association, and during the weekend of April 30 to May 2 volunteers from both organizations met at Me-Own Airstrip, (1NM0) for a work party. This remote airstrip lies at an elevation of 7,554 and is special in that it is close to the Gila Wilderness Area, and immediately adjacent to the Aldo Leopold Wilderness area.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wilderness-entrance-1-768x1024.jpg">



<p>In all, nine planes and 16 volunteers arrived to accomplish the maintenance. RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron&nbsp;Keller&nbsp;reports that the group cleared encroaching trees and rebuilt the segmented circle to include traffic arms.&nbsp;Keller&nbsp;said they will finish painting the segmented circle soon. &nbsp;“One pilot, new to Me-Own, flew all the way from Steamboat Springs, Colorado to help,”&nbsp;Keller&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Many of us hiked into the Aldo Leopold Wilderness after the work was finished,”&nbsp;Keller&nbsp;added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“McKenzie Bridge Airport in the Central Oregon Cascades is popular with recreational aviators. It provides access to the McKenzie River, mountain bike trails, and remote camping,” RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes says. To ensure the continued utility of the airport, Mayes has been awarded an RAF grant to employ a contractor to mow the airfield. He expects the first mowing in early June, the second by the end of September, and will supervise the contractor and provide safety oversight.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mckenzie-bridge-3.jpg">McKenzie Bridge Airport


<p>The airstrip lies in the Willamette National Forest, and Mayes announced that the USFS will use a portion of this year’s federally-allocated funds to make additional improvements. The USFS committed to purchase a fire ring and all-weather picnic table each for McKenzie Bridge and Toketee State (3S6) airports. Installation will require RAF volunteer labor and some additional materials,” Mayes said. Watch for future announcements of volunteer work parties when health restrictions have been relaxed.</p>



<p>RAF members have volunteered to assist the Oregon Department of Aviation with upkeep of McKenzie Bridge Airport. For the past three years Mayes has organized at least two volunteer work parties each year to perform maintenance and safety improvements at the airport. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;daCOKQNCXqJmthBTEpqT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">airfield.guide</a>.</p>



<p>Red’s Wallowa Horse Ranch, (6OR9)&nbsp;<br>Mayes also recently reported, “I have some good news.” He went on to describe developments resulting from an April 26 meeting with the US Forest Service. Red’s Wallowa Horse Ranch airstrip lies on Forest Service administered lands within the Eagle Cap Wilderness Area, where only non-mechanized equipment can be used for maintenance and improvements. The agency has agreed to fund the purchase of a new horse drawn mower and contribute $1,000 toward mowing this year. Additional USFS funds are committed for materials to build an outhouse at the camping area, the purchase of a web camera, and invasive weed eradication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayes adds, “We must extend our gratitude to RAF Ambassador Bill Ables for his efforts to achieve these great outcomes. Bill’s proactive approach to collaboration with USFS, Idaho Aviation Association and the Wallowa County Pilot’s Association has ensured Red’s will remain the premier backcountry airstrip in Oregon.” See the <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?89https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/fbe82ea4-7900-4b4d-8e6f-7651cc30b541/overview?searchQuery=mcke2;TXmSVCmqulYuDkxWgoXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">airfiel</a>
<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;TXmSVCmqulYuDkxWgoXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">d.guide</a>. </p>



<p>Mayes has plans for other Oregon airstrips. “The next goal will be to obtain Forest Service funding for an outhouse at&nbsp;Toketee&nbsp;and Bill has plans for some improvements at&nbsp;Dug Bar,” he said, adding, “We are finally getting some of that USFS money into actual airfield works!”&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Alaska State Liaison</strong>
</h2>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/JeffDeFreest1.jpg">



<p>Jeff DeFreest started flying early in life – logging his first hours in 1972 – but his flight training stalled until he was well into his career as a professional geologist with the US Forest Service (USFS). He worked in Idaho, Oregon, and Utah before transitioning to Alaska in 2001.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before moving to Alaska, he had restarted his flight training and got an introduction to backcountry flying in the San Rafael Desert in Utah. He flew SuperCubs in Arizona on weekends, while studying to become a certified minerals examiner for the USFS. He earned his private pilot certificate in Alaska on the 99<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary of powered flight on December 17, 2002.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jeff earned his Single Engine Seaplane rating at Kenmore Air near Seattle, then trained in Oregon to fly in actual IMC conditions, then both Comm SES and SEL in Alaska flying Beavers, and earned his Comm MEL in Arizona, all while serving in various capacities with the USFS.</p>



<p>Jeff’s first airplane was a Cessna 170B on floats, which he put on wheels to engage in year-around flying in SE Alaska. He started visiting logging camp airstrips, river delta and gravel bar strips while on conventional gear, and accessing USFS lake cabins on floats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 2010-2017, he served as&nbsp;District Ranger for the 3.3 million acre Ketchikan-Misty Fiords Ranger District on the Tongass National Forest. This district is made&nbsp;up of about two-thirds National Monument and Wilderness and one third multiple use Forest Service lands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Ketchikan Jeff met Kari, his wife to be. They invested in a Skywagon on floats for their first anniversary to visit the many USFS lake cabins in the panhandle of SE Alaska. In 2017 Jeff was offered the position of USFS Alaska Regional Geologist and the couple moved to Juneau. He also had collateral duties working in the lands program, and for the fire aviation program with single engine air tankers. Jeff conducted rifle training for federal&nbsp;employees, and also assisted with ANILCA (Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980) training for federal, state, and native corporation employees, as well as tribal members. Jeff retired in November&nbsp;of 2020 but continues to serve on the ANILCA training cadre, works part time on-call for the fire aviation program, helps Alaska youth in Hunter Education, and was appointed to the Alaska Minerals Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kari and Jeff are passionate about the USFS cabins on the many amazing lakes in SE Alaska and spend much of their free time lake-hopping with their Skywagon and advocating for the USFS to keep those fly-in cabins available to the public.</p>

<p>Improvements are continuing this spring at the RAF-supported Cornucopia, WI airstrip, W123. Cornucopia is the northernmost village in Wisconsin and sits on the south shore of Lake Superior, adjacent to the magnificent Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. “Not only is the scenery absolutely spectacular, but there are also incredible recreational opportunities in the area including kayaking to the sea caves, hiking to waterfalls and the shoreline above the caves, and trout fishing in a nearby stream,” RAF Director Jeff Russell says.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cornucopia1.png">


<p>In 2019 a pilot shelter was placed at the airstrip with help from the Village of Cornucopia and the RAF. In mid-April, RAF Wisconsin Liaison Trever Otto and Russell flew in to install flooring, and help trim brush. Further plans for the pilot shelter include electrical wiring and finishing the interior walls. “It is simply amazing how the local community is rallying behind their strip,” Russell adds. The electrical work is being donated by electrician Jesse Kaseno and his daughter. “It certainly doesn’t hurt that Jesse is also the brother of the airport manager, Tim Kaseno,” Russell points out. To finish the interior walls, Matt Hipsher is donating and milling the white pine lumber, harvested right off his local farm.</p>



<p>The Village and the RAF have been working with the Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics to change Cornucopia’s listing from private to public use. To support this change, projects were started earlier this spring including removing brush from the sides of the runway and clearing a few trees. Airport Manager Tim Kaseno secured cones per Aeronautics’ directions to mark the runway. Local business owner Josh Illick donated his time and equipment to clear a large area of brush. “It’s simply amazing what a skid steer with a brush deck can accomplish in the hands of a skilled operator,” Russell said.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/presleymelton.jpeg">



<p>After years of experience flying his Boeing Stearman, Decathlons, an RV8, his award-winning 1943 Howard DGA, and a variety of other aircraft, RAF Ambassador&nbsp;Presley&nbsp;Melton of Arkansas says he has the most fun in his open-cockpit AirCam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years ago,&nbsp;Presley&nbsp;journeyed out west in his RV8, enjoying Idaho’s groomed turf airfields, but realized he wanted something that he could safely take into more backcountry places. He decided on the AirCam, an aircraft that was originally a one-off creation, specifically built to fly photographers over Africa’s jungle canopy, where a forced landing could drop you near the den of a hungry lion or poisonous snake. It provided the safety and redundancy of two engines and a very slow stall speed. “It’s like flying a canoe, or a motorcycle. Your elbows are out in the breeze and the view is incredible,”&nbsp;Presley&nbsp;says. Due to public demand, the AirCam design was turned into a kit, and there are now several hundred flying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a long way to Idaho from Arkansas at eighty miles an hour, though,” he added, and now&nbsp;Presley&nbsp;has a Murphy Super Rebel, that he describes as an Experimental Cessna 180. The faster Murphy with an enclosed cockpit makes very long trips much easier. He looks forward to many more years of recreational flying. “Flying is a team sport” he says. When he announced his plans to fly to Big Bend National Park in Texas, “which is on the way to nowhere else,” he was joined by seven other aircraft. “I’ve been very blessed to have made a bunch of friends through aviation,” he says.</p>



<p>While enjoying South Carolina’s Triple Tree fly-in, he was invited to join Mark Baker and John McKenna’s breakfast conversation and became motivated to help the RAF and its mission.&nbsp;Presley&nbsp;retired from a three-generation business, having turned his casket sales business over to his two sons. Now he typically flies between 120 to 150 hours per year. It is very likely RAF members will spot him in any one of his current airplanes at an event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presley&nbsp;and about ten other pilots and family members volunteered&nbsp;recently&nbsp;to assist The Nature Conservancy on a restoration project along a tributary of the Kings River in northern Arkansas. The group planted hundreds of trees. “It was our way to give back, in appreciation for what The Nature Conservancy has given us,” he said, referring to Trigger Gap, (17A) the airfield that the RAF and Arkansas volunteers created near Bentonville on land leased from TNC.&nbsp;</p>]]>

<p>The open air pavilion is nearing completion at&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;Gap&nbsp;Airfield in Arkansas, 17A. Volunteers came from 12 states representing RAF members, the Tailwind Aviation Foundation, and local Fly Oz friends, most of whom are also RAF members.</p>



<p>“We had a very successful work party,” RAF Arkansas Liaison Dave Powell said. “All had a great time and enjoyed building community together in addition to structures,” he added. The Nature Conservancy staff also came out including Scott Simon, Arkansas TNC Director.</p>



<p>“I was awed by the skill, enthusiasm and can-do attitude of each and every one of our forty volunteers,” RAF Arkansas Liaison Harper Goodwin said. Everyone contributed, some by screwing 16-inch screws into massive beams&nbsp;with big hammer drills, while others dug trenches, installed wiring and lighting, built a shower tent, mowed, leveled new areas, and spread grass seed, he reported. There were trips to the hardware store. Folks boiled some crawfish, and cooked for the crew. “My goodness did they cook . . . three meals a day,” Harper added. “Everyone was an important cog in the wheel and it was a lot of fun seeing it run smoothly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the pavilion, the crew replaced windsock frames, cut and split firewood, fabricated chairs and painted them along with cementing in a new monument sign. Stone masons are scheduled over the next several weeks to create a stone fireplace and wall to finish the pavilion.</p>



<p>“I am very proud of what we all accomplished and most of all I cherish the friendships that were made. I look forward to crossing paths with each and every one of the team as we now have a special bond, with&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;Gap&nbsp;and the RAF as the foundation,” Harper said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF thanks all who contributed their time or monetary donations toward this project, and values its relationship with Fly Oz and The Nature Conservancy.</p>



<p>See details about Trigger Gap in the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/f6ed09bf-07ec-4302-96c8-9f80743ae0c4/overview?searchQuery=trigger">Airfield Guide</a>.</p>



<p>
<strong>Volunteers Improve Richland Creek</strong>
</p>



<p>In addition to all the work accomplished at&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;Gap, volunteers took on projects at Richland Creek airfield, 4AR9. They constructing a composting toilet similar to&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;Gap&nbsp;and erected a gazebo with wood cut by the same Amish supplier who provided timbers for the&nbsp;Trigger&nbsp;Gap&nbsp;pavilion.&nbsp;<em>(Photos and report to follow.)</em>
</p>



<p>“Trigger Gap and Richland Creek are but two more examples of the best that the RAF can be…not only did we build structures but once again we built community,” said RAF Chairman John McKenna. “Big thanks goes out to the folks who traveled near and far to help as well as to those that contributed the funding needed to buy what hard work alone could not.” The Richland Creek listing can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;HQTAJMjgGqhccwNCaqHx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a press release announced by Hartzell Propeller. </p>



<img src="https://hartzellprop.com/wp-content/uploads/Voyager-Prop-for-RAF-1024x727.jpg">



<p>Hartzell Propeller has reached an agreement with the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) to offer a special $1,000 discount on all new Hartzell backcountry propellers sold to RAF members. The RAF is a national organization headquartered in Bozeman, Mont., which is dedicated to preserving, improving and creating airstrips for recreational access.</p>



<p>“Hartzell Propeller is making this offer to RAF members through the end of 2022 as part of our commitment to the excitement and fun of backcountry flying,” said Hartzell Propeller President JJ Frigge. “The RAF has prevented the closure of a number of airstrips and even built new ones. We are excited to be a part of the legacy established by these dedicated pilots.”</p>



<p>The propeller offerings included in this partnership include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Voyager, a 3-blade metal scimitar propeller designed for the Cessna 180, 182, 185 and 206 fleet</li>
<li>The Trailblazer, a 2-blade composite prop available for the Aviat Husky, American Champion Scout, Maule M-7-235 and host of experimental aircraft</li>
<li>The Explorer, a 3-blade composite prop available for a number of experimental aircraft</li>
<li>The Pathfinder, a 3-blade composite prop available on the Cubcrafters XCub and Carbon Cub FX, as well as several experimental aircraft.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each of these propellers is designed to maximize performance for backcountry operations, including shorter take-off rolls and better climb rates.</p>



<p>“For those of us who love the land and the special backcountry places that only our airplanes can take us, our more than 9,000 RAF members appreciate this very welcome initiative from Hartzell Propeller,” said RAF Chairman John J. McKenna, Jr. “These new propellers are a direct testament to Hartzell’s commitment to innovation for backcountry airplanes and pilots. With added performance and reduced noise levels, all in the backcountry community will appreciate Hartzell’s new propellers,” he added.</p>



<p>“Through this new promotion, Hartzell’s commitment will be an exceptional benefit to current RAF members and an extremely welcome incentive to becoming a new RAF member,” McKenna said. In addition to providing the RAF discount, Hartzell Propeller will make a $250 contribution directly to the RAF organization for every member who buys a new Hartzell prop for backcountry flying until the end of 2022.</p>



<p>Hartzell Propeller is the global leader in advanced technology aircraft propeller design and manufacturing for business, commercial and government customers. The company designs next generation propellers with innovative blended airfoil technology and manufactures them with revolutionary machining centers, robotics and custom resin transfer molding curing stations.</p>

<strong>About the Recreational Aviation Foundation</strong>
<br>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) was founded by a group of Montana pilots who realized the threat of recreational airstrip closure was of national concern. They also recognized there was a need for a unified effort by pilots everywhere to protect public recreational opportunities. The RAF, a 501(c)(3) organization, is dedicated to preserving existing airstrips and creating new public-use recreational airstrips throughout the United States.

<strong>John with Eli, John’s grandson and future pilot extraordinaire.</strong>



<p>After ten years of flying pavement to pavement around New England, John&nbsp;Nadeau&nbsp;and his wife Ann Marie acquired property near his family vacation home in Maine. An abandoned airfield laid in the backwoods that he and friends reclaimed over a summer, and John landed on a grass runway for the first time on his own private airport.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I allowed other pilots to use the airfield and camp, but I worried about liability,” John said. In 2007, he read an article in&nbsp;<em>AOPA Pilot</em>&nbsp;about a Montana group that had added “aviation” to something called a “Recreational Use Statute,” or RUS in Montana. “The phone number listed was John McKenna’s and, after fighting through our language barrier, he understood that I wanted to get involved. We think that I became the first RAF volunteer east of the Mississippi River,”&nbsp;Nadeau&nbsp;says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John held a New England RAF recruitment meeting called the Black Fly Smashin’ Fly-In at Sanford, Maine, attended Florida’s Sun ‘n Fun with the RAF, and was invited to the RAF Strategic Planning Conference in Driggs, Idaho in 2010. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But John’s efforts to get aviation added to the Maine RUS are nonpareil. Adding aviation language to other states’ RUS became an RAF priority, with the goal of access to more private airfields. John became the go-to guy on the initiative. He volunteered to help other RAF State Liaisons through the legislative process. He researched the history of RUS enactment, and has read all 50 state recreational use statutes a number of times, “but I admit, I have memorized none of them. As one old college professor said, memorization is nice, but the important thing is to learn where to look things up,” he says.&nbsp;Whatever his methods, John’s contributions have been invaluable, even if some westerners have trouble with his&nbsp;<em>r</em>-dropping Eastern New England English.</p>

<p>RAF Virginia Liaison Alan White has been awarded an RAF grant to make improvements to Barrows Field (VA04) in Fincastle, Virginia. Barrows&nbsp;is home to R&amp;B Aircraft, makers of Bearhawk aircraft.</p>



<p>White’s plans include establishing a camping and picnic area along the river, repairing the outhouse, clearing encroaching limbs, and installing an RAF windsock. He expects to clear a new riverwalk trail that has been surveyed, and mark other trails and the shooting range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This will serve pilots of the entire Mid-Atlantic Region,” he says, adding, “Bearhawk aircraft hosts an annual fly-in/camp-out that draws Bearhawk airplanes from across the nation and Canada.”</p>



<p>“There are very few airstrips along the east coast that are catering to the airplane camper,” White says. “Owner Bob Barrows would love to see this become a destination facility and has included it in the Airfield Guide.”</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tongass-Wilderness2-1024x768.jpeg">



<p>RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton, RAF members Bill Rusk and Jeff DeFreest report that the US Forest Service cabins primarily in Southeast Alaska that are available for public use may be in jeopardy of closure.&nbsp;Alaska’s Tongass National Forest is the nation’s largest National Forest, and includes 142 cabins accessible by boat, trail, seaplane, and a few by wheeled aircraft. 26 are accessed by flight only, and the USFS is questioning the feasibility of maintaining them.</p>



<p>Threats of closure are due to perceived low usage, and proven high cost of maintenance. DeFreest recently retired from a career with the Forest Service and pointed out that the cabins typically have wood or oil heat, and Forest Service personnel have been supplying fuel and firewood, at significant cost. Decreasing funding has strained USFS resources. They published a document “Sustainable Cabin Strategy, with their findings, but concluded that the fly-in only cabins were under-utilized, and were no longer cost effective. See:  <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd687218.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd687218.pdf</a>
</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tongass-Wilderness1-1024x768.jpeg">



<p>Clayton reminds pilots that more cabins “are within forty-five minutes of Anchorage in a 180.”&nbsp; Clayton has had success building relationships with federal and state agencies, and has organized volunteers from EAA Chapter 42 that have made improvements on airstrips within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, USFS lands, and Chugach State Park.</p>



<p>RAF Director Jeff Russell asks, “What other organization is better equipped to help with advocacy and help [preserve]&nbsp;this recreational resource?” He referred to the recent five-year renewal of the RAF’s Memorandum of Understanding with the USFS, and the companion Master Cost Share Agreement, authorizing the RAF to cooperate with the USFS to preserve and improve its airstrips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF encourages pilots to enjoy the cabins and spread word of the unique wilderness opportunity they offer. Floatplane Charter services are available to anyone without water landing ability.</p>



<p>The RAF is seeking volunteers in the region who are willing to get involved. Please contact RAF Alaska Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:aclayton@theraf.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Al Clayton</a>&nbsp;for ways you can help. “These cabins are a true treasure in one of the most beautiful parts of the world,” Russell said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Lisa Ellington, a fifth-generation Texan, grew up on a farm in South Texas. Every day was an adventure with horses, cows, pigs, and chickens (most of whom were pets), as well as numerous dogs and cats. Her family took fun summer trips around the US, such as hiking the Grand Canyon, canoeing the Rio Grande, and sailing the Gulf Coast. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lisa’s communications career included journalism jobs at newspapers in San Antonio and Corpus Christi, Texas. Her interest in aviation led to work in commercial and military aviation, and finally general aviation at Redbird Skyport at San Marcos Regional Airport.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A self-proclaimed hangar rat, she enjoyed working on several innovative refurbishment projects, including the Redhawk Cessna 172 trainers and a 1960 Beech 50 Twin Bonanza. Meeting members of the RAF team at Oshkosh in 2013, Lisa immediately felt a bond and volunteered to help in the RAF mission. Some of her past efforts include helping with mailings, membership, and writing and proofing copy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lisa is working remotely as she travels through the southeastern coast in her R-Pod travel trailer. She hopes to meet old and new friends in the aviation community campgrounds at Sun ’n Fun and Airventure, and resume her hangar flying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Indiana State Liaison</h2>



<p>Bill grew up in a flying family. He graduated in 1979 from Purdue University in Indiana with a degree in Professional Pilot Technology. “I was teaching and flying Part 135 in what was then a horrible aviation job market,” he says.</p>



<p>Eventually becoming engaged full time in a family construction business, Bill flew a club Bonanza and a Cherokee Six to projects around the Midwest.</p>



<p>In 2012 he purchased a Cessna 140A and began exploring grass airstrips and enjoying camping on the field wherever it was allowed.</p>



<p>A flight to North Fox Island in 2015 shortly after it opened led him to RAF Michigan Li- aison Brad Frederick, and to an appreciation for the RAF mission of creating, improving and preserving places like North Fox Island.</p>



<p>Bill bought a Cessna 172 in 2018 and has been upgrading it for backcountry flying and camping.</p>



<p>“I look forward to more exploring with my 172, attending RAF events, and participating at work parties to help improve RAF support- ed fields in my area,” he says.</p>

<p>Mike Ginter, Vice President of AOPA’s Airports and State Advocacy anchored an RAF “Fire Hub Chat” session with State Liaisons, Ambassadors and the RAF Board on February 16.</p>



<p>AOPA organizes its US membership into seven multi-state regions in order to focus on specific issues. (Only the Alaska region is comprised of a single state.) All told, there are 19,300 US landing facilities, both public and private. Each regional manager oversees their Airport Support Network volunteers, of which there are currently 1,879, many of whom are RAF members. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aopa.org/ASN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.aopa.org/ASN</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each AOPA regional manager is a registered lobbyist with the credentials to advocate in state legislatures. In fact, Western Pacific manager Melissa McCaffrey was in meetings during Hawaii’s legislative session, and could not join the RAF/AOPA call.</p>



<p>Regional managers are vigilant about potential airport and airspace issues, such as funding, threats of closures, fees and taxes, encroachments to airspace, and drone regulation; with the overarching emphasis on safety and retaining GA access and affordable services. Ginter said that currently these professionals are working on over 100 cases.</p>



<p>RAF and AOPA missions intersect and reinforce one another, especially on preserving access and improving safety.</p>



<p>“Our approach is to find ways to mutually co-exist with those who could affect safety or access with things like wind turbines and towers,” Ginter said. Many airports face pressure to close from developers. Industrial parks, affordable housing, and other uses of airport property appear lucrative to those who perceive that an airport is not economically productive. Midwest Regional Manager Kyle Lewis noted RAF’s collaborative efforts with AOPA and the Minnesota Pilots Association in saving Isle Airport in Minnesota.</p>



<p>Noise is another issue, when residents are annoyed by frequent low flying aircraft, especially helicopters. “Anti-aircraft groups are small, but vocal,” Ginter said, acknowledging challenges that RAF state liaisons have encountered, as well.</p>



<p>The RAF team regularly interfaces with AOPA on a variety of fronts, and has enjoyed great collaboration over the years.<br>
<br>“My interaction with AOPA on behalf of the RAF over the past couple of years has been absolutely great,” RAF Director Jeff Russell said. “AOPA has been very helpful promoting adjacent turf runways, and finding creative solutions on airport ownership models when a municipality or county fears liability exposure.”</p>



<p>A recent example of collaboration was during the Death Valley National Park Stovepipe Wells public comment period, promoted by both RAF and the AOPA. AOPA is in dialog with the NPS about improving Furnace Creek, another Death Valley National Park recreational airport.</p>



<p>“AOPA has connections with the FAA, with Congress, and has generations of valuable knowledge. Mike Ginter and his team of regional managers have been a great partner&nbsp;with the RAF,” Russell added.

<p>Meghann and her dog Roger are longtime friends of the RAF.  Meghann owns and operates an insurance and financial planning practice based out of Bozeman, Montana. Roger is currently between employment opportunities and not looking very hard.</p>
<p>While most of Meghann’s time in the air is spent sitting in an exit row window on a commercial flight, she has a great appreciation for backcountry flying and all the pleasure it brings to the aviation community.  Roger on the other hand prefers a weekend camping adventure, or maybe just an afternoon of seeing and sniffing the sights.  </p>
<p>When not volunteering for The RAF, Meghann serves on the board of a land conservation and trails organization as well as two national reinsurance companies.  She and Roger can also be found hiking all times of the year or baking up gourmet goodies and sharing them, often to the delight of RAF work party volunteers. </p>]]>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JohnMcKennaMOUsigning.png">Here are USFS Recreation Director Martin (on screen) and John McKenna during their virtual signing ceremony.



<p>RAF Chairman John McKenna and US Forest Service Recreational Director Michiko Martin on January 6 co-signed a five-year renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding between the USFS and the RAF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The RAF has worked consistently for the last eighteen years to build a good working relationship with the Forest Service at the district, regional, and national level,” RAF Idaho Liaison Tim Riley said, adding, “These efforts resulted in the original five-year Memorandum of Understanding signed in March of 2015.” The document established aviation within USFS Planning Directives as one of the three legs of the National Forest Transportation System on 155 national forests, twenty national grasslands and seven national monuments. “This formal MOU lends credibility to our vision and efforts to preserve backcountry airstrips on public lands,” RAF Arizona State Liaison Mark Spencer said.</p>



<p>“Working together, we are tracking projects&nbsp;and access to eighty-seven airstrips on Forest Service lands in seven of the nine Forest Service Regions across the country,” Riley said.</p>



<p>Riley also pointed out that RAF engagement with Congress resulted in an annual Federal allocation of $750,000 for the maintenance and preservation of backcountry airstrips on USFS lands.</p>



<p>The RAF also has a Master Challenge Cost Share agreement with the USFS to identify specific projects and leverage RAF volunteers and funding in public/private partnership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This arrangement multiplies the benefit of the dollars that the Forest Service can spend on projects,” McKenna said. “Our wide group of volunteers and collaborators like state pilot groups provide the boots on the ground.”</p>

<p>Unlike cookies, whiskey or wine, you are not limited to “just one” when it comes to membership in aviation organizations. If you are one of our 10,000 Recreational Aviation Foundation members, we value your support, but suggest you don’t stop there. Please consider supporting your local or state pilot group and type club. The RAF has been fueled and guided by aviation organizations across the country that are hugely supportive of the RAF mission and aviation in general. The RAF feels strongly that we are much stronger together. </p>



<p>State pilot organizations have local knowledge, and care about aviation in their regions. Our RAF State Liaisons reach out to these groups and offer partnership and resources through the RAF Grant program and sources of volunteer help,&nbsp;accomplishing much more by teaming up.&nbsp;So please join or renew your membership with your local pilot association today!</p>



<p>We are also proud of our great relationship with AOPA and EAA, and encourage you to support these worthwhile organizations. Each has its own vital mission, and all serve to promote the interests of General Aviation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is only so much time in the day and so much money in your wallet, so why not spend it with people with like interests and a passion for aviation? We may all fly something different but if we work together, we are sure to enjoy a collective tailwind.</p>

<p>The RAF thanks all who took the time to submit comments supporting Stovepipe Wells Airport in Death Valley National Park before the comment deadline closed on December 23. Your comments count, and we are awaiting the outcome.<br>&nbsp;<br>RAF California Liaisons Rick Lach and Katerina Barilov learned of plans to close the airport and convert it to a dark sky viewing site, and issued an RAF Call To Action.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“We are encouraged by the significant outpouring of public support from RAF members as well as the general public,” Barilov said. “It demonstrates the immense value that airports such as this have to the pilot community and the public as a whole.” Many comments cited locations where aviation and stargazing are compatible activities and are successfully combined.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Lach and Barilov are having an ongoing, active conversation with park service officials to discuss potential ways to share the grounds with dark sky viewing while preserving aircraft access. Through the established cooperative MOU between the RAF and the NPS, the Liaisons can commit to ways to maintain access and mitigate NPS maintenance costs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“We are hopeful that we can reach a suitable outcome for all parties involved,” Barilov said, adding, “The Park Service sees how cherished this access point is. It presents&nbsp;another way to visit the many recreational activities available in Death Valley National Park.”&nbsp;</p>]]>

<p>Arizona State Liaison Mark Spencer, who also serves as the Arizona Pilots Association (APA) First Vice President, reports that work is ongoing at Grapevine airstrip (88AZ). This year volunteers will continue to improve drainage and safety at the strip by spreading and compacting 400 tons of material that was delivered the first week of December. The&nbsp;$10,000 worth of&nbsp;material was purchased through USFS funds,&nbsp;made possible by&nbsp;the Recreational Aviation Foundation’s Master Challenge Cost Share agreement&nbsp;with the USFS.&nbsp;In lieu of a cash match, APA and the RAF agreed to provide volunteer labor of par value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>APA President Brian Schober had delivered his tractor to help spread the material. “Our most senior supporters of the Grapevine efforts, Paul and Charlie Pitkin, were there to help,” Spencer said. Paul turned 86 recently and has continually supported efforts to re-open Grapevine and keep it open. Paul and Charlie also provide firewood and picnic supplies for events.&nbsp;Jeff&nbsp;Wilson&nbsp;and Tommy Thomason resealed cracks on the runway.</p>



<p>Spencer thanks Mike and Diana Andresen, Brian Schober, Chris Nugent, Rick Bosshardt, Rodney Tang, Paul Pitkin, Tracy Hardy, Leanne Rowan, and Ron Peters for their efforts spreading and compacting the material.&nbsp;More material is on the way in the new year.&nbsp;”Grapevine requires a lot of work to keep going, but is well worth it based on the number of inquiries we receive about visiting the strip,” Spencer said. “We will be reaching out this new year for help with additional maintenance,” he added.</p>



<p>Spencer has coordinated for years with Tonto National Forest District Ranger Kelly&nbsp;Jardine, and refers to him as “an RAF and APA friend and supporter.” Mr. Jardine has started the NEPA process for installing a vault toilet at Grapevine this year from the Cost Share agreement funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Grapevine gets better every year thanks to pilot support and teamwork with the Forest Service,” Spencer added.<br>

Pilots should also check in with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AZPilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">APA Facebook page</a> and Prescott Flight Service at 122.5 or 800-992-7433 for updates on military use of Grapevine. “We try to coordinate this use, but being charted as a private airstrip makes NOTAMS specific to the airstrip impossible,” he added. CTAF at Grapevine is 122.9. </p>

<p>Having grown up in Montana, Kodi spent plenty of time camping, hiking, kayaking, and doing many other things outdoors. She understands the passion that so many RAF supporters share for discovering remote places. </p>



<p>Kodi started working for the RAF in 2019 while attending Montana State University. She was initially hired as an intern to assist with the RAF’s switch to a new database and website. Upon graduation, she transitioned to a full time role and most enjoys the friendships she has gained through the RAF.</p>

<p>Managers of Death Valley National Park in California are seeking public input regarding future use of the park’s Stovepipe Wells Village. One of the park’s proposals is to change the Stovepipe Wells airstrip into a dedicated night sky viewing area due to the prohibitive maintenance expense of repaving the runway. This is due to the park’s perceived lack of visitation to the strip, combined with a growing interest in attendees in night-sky astronomy. With this change, the airstrip is in danger of closing entirely to light aircraft visitation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) believes that pilot activity and stargazing can successfully co-exist with minor changes to existing infrastructure, and we are urging members to submit comments to the park in support of both pastimes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Death Valley National Park is more specifically proposing the following change (the following text was captured from the park’s official Facebook page):<br>
<br>
<strong>• </strong>
<em>Night Sky Viewing to Replace Airstrip: night sky viewing events in the park regularly attract over 250 people, and very few people use the airstrip at Stovepipe Wells. The park proposes changing the airstrip into a place where astronomical societies can set up and camp with their large telescopes, while providing an opportunity to experience the park’s spectacular dark skies. The Furnace Creek Airport, 18 miles away, would still be available for small planes.</em>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>If the Park Service does not receive at least 400 comments from the pilot community regarding Stovepipe Wells, they will ignore the pilot’s input. WE NEED YOU TO COMMENT THROUGH THE NPS WEBSITE COMMENT SUBMISSION FORM BEFORE DECEMBER 23.</strong>
<br>
<br>Additional details and<strong> the comment submission form</strong> can be found at the following link (once you are on the NPS page, click on the ‘comment now’ button):<br>&nbsp;<br>
<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=297&amp;projectID=72747&amp;documentID=107887" target="_blank">https://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=297&amp;projectID=72747&amp;documentID=107887</a>
<br>
<strong>&nbsp;<br>The RAF suggests the following&nbsp;talking points&nbsp;for members who wish to comment:</strong>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilots support stargazing. This is a very successful combination of compatible pastimes. This has been proven at Havana, Illinois, where fly-in stargazing events draw many campers both by air and car. The Blue Canyon airport at Nyack, in Tahoe National Forest is another perfect example.<br>&nbsp;<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp; Current facilities at Stovepipe Wells are at about 1/2 mile hike away. The airstrip will see a significant increase in visitation should facilities such as a dedicated camping area, as well as toilets be provided to visitors to the airport.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 3,260 x 65 ft and a significant existing visitors area, there is ample room for both activities at Stovepipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing for under-wing camping at the airstrip helps disperse usage, and puts no additional strain on the NPS campground.<br>&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its daylight use by small planes minimizes impact to campers and star&nbsp;gazers.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This airport has historical value, having been established in 1948.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stovepipe Airstrip provides another feasible way to access this special land. For many, driving to Stovepipe Wells represents a huge investment of time, and access by small plane opens up that opportunity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you in advance for your support of this RAF Call to Action! The RAF will be following up with final comments on our website in the near future.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Questions may be directed to CA State Liaisons <strong>Rick Lach</strong>:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:rlach@theraf.org" target="_blank">rlach@theraf.org&nbsp;</a>and/or <strong>Katerina Barilov</strong>:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:kbarilov@theraf.org" target="_blank">kbarilov@theraf.org</a>.</p>

<p>The RAF is pleased to announce that one of the country’s most distinctive airports has been saved from potential closure.</p>



<p>Goodspeed Airport, (42B) lies beside the historic Connecticut River in East Haddam, CT. The airport has a 2,120-ft paved runway, a parallel turf runway, and is the only seaplane base in southern New England, listed as 4,500 feet in length. Nearby is a 1913 swing bridge that swivels on a turntable to allow river traffic through.</p>



<p>Visitors can camp at this scenic recreational airport, and just off the end of Runway 32 within easy walking distance is a typical New England village and the Goodspeed Opera House, world famous for its Tony-award-winning productions. “The beautiful surrounding countryside is brimming with restaurants, shops, and galleries,” its website says.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Goodspeed4-1024x768.jpg">



<p>“I learned that the original owner put this airport up for sale, and that this airport could close,” RAF Director Bill Brine said. “In addition to its aviation features, the location has great potential as a place for folks to experience unique riverfront habitat,” he added. He connected with two local aviation enthusiasts who understood that action was needed to preserve this special airport.</p>



<p>They tapped the resources of a third-party foundation that agreed to help preserve Goodspeed because its unique&nbsp;layout allows for aviation education and training. This aspect appealed to the RAF as the airport provides&nbsp;southern New England&nbsp;pilots an experience not easily found in the region. The RAF provided funds toward the down payment, leveraging the local group into an outright purchase. They have begun upgrading facilities to boost seaplane use, fuel sales, hangar rentals and eventually provide for repairs and maintenance, to ensure the airport is self-sustaining. The RAF agreed to terms that excess revenues from operations will go to capital improvements.</p>



<p>“All the pieces are in place for success in preserving the airport for public use in perpetuity,” Brine said. “Regardless of the outcome, the RAF’s position is guaranteed,” he explained, “and the agreement is transferable in case ownership changes.”</p>



<p>Brine encourages pilots to put this special place on their list of recreational places to fly. “Without the RAF as conduit, this cool little airport would have been lost,” he said.</p>

<p>So, where does the name “Bogdan” come from?</p>



<p>“Poland” is his answer. Bogdan’s parents immigrated to the East Coast when he was a child. “They were farmers in Europe, and came over with the four of us kids, and like many Poles, Dad went to work in the steel mills,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogdan chose the construction field, and approached flying in an unusual way. During a Christmas break when his kids were home from school, he noticed that one of his two daughters had gone on the FAA website and selected the free PDF flying handbook. He picked it up and began studying for his pilot license.</p>



<p>“I also discovered that Piper Cub plans were in the Public Domain,” he said. Being a builder, it seemed reasonable to him to just order a bundle of tubing, fabric, and wire from Wag Aero and start putting an airplane together, like he would construct a building. “The challenge was getting a decent reliable engine,” he said. To solve that problem, he bought a bargain Cessna 150,&nbsp; thinking he could “scalp the engine out of it for the homemade Cub,” but he enjoyed flying his little Cessna so much, that plan fell by the wayside. He learned soft and short field techniques, and found his niche in flying. Exploring turf fields soon fit right in to his other outdoor interests of winter camping and sailing.</p>



<p>He met RAF and EAA people along the way, “folks who are very passionate about keeping up older airplanes,” he said. One of them put him in touch with a 1946 Aeronca Champ that needed a new home, and he’s been flying it ever since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daughter who was intrigued with aviation in high school helped volunteer to contact owners of private airfields in Connecticut. She was gratified when she got many positive results. Her dad took her to Oshkosh, and she soon earned a scholarship from Embry-Riddle and went on to become an airport safety technician. She refers to&nbsp;her branch of Civil Engineering as “Paviation” as in Pavement for Aviation.</p>



<p>When Bogdan attended an RAF presentation in Meriden, CT years ago, he knew he wanted to get involved. Now that he is slowing down to partially retire from construction, he looks forward to helping more toward the RAF mission.</p>



<p>“I’m very grateful to RAF for their support of Goodspeed airport,” he said. “I await the day when I will be camping on the field with the rest of the RAF crew,” he added.</p>

<p>The RAF has granted $14,000 toward the preservation of Minnesota’s Isle Airport, (MY72). Minnesota Liaison Kirk Hiner and RAF Director Emeritus Peter Burwell met with Isle Airport management to agree on cost sharing a project to remove encroaching trees that were threatening to close the airport. In June, the RAF reported that the city council voted to keep the Isle airport open, in response to the positive input resulting from the RAF’s Call To Action. This tree-removal project will ensure that the airport survives to serve the community and region around Isle.</p>



<p>Over the past few decades, trees beyond the south end of the runway presented a major hazard to aviation and a decision last year by the State of Minnesota to close the airport. After extensive negotiations with the city, the Isle Airport Association agreed to pay for professional tree removal. In spite of IAA’s best efforts to raise the money, there was a shortfall, and the RAF grant will cover that portion.</p>



<p>In return for the grant, the IAA is giving all RAF members a pass to land at Isle, without having to request prior permission.</p>



<p>Isle Airport is a well-maintained turf airport and has many recreational attributes. Visitors can enjoy underwing camping, access to two airport cars and several bicycles for transportation to the many fishing resorts, restaurants, and other attractions of this central Minnesota lakes region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tree removal must be done after the ground freezes, and is expected to be completed by year-end.</p>



<p>“This is a great airport that the RAF was able to participate in saving, and will remain open for years to come,” Burwell said. “Fishing on Lake Mille Lacs might be in the future for some RAF members,” Hiner added.</p>

<p>A picnic pavilion is going up at Havana Regional (9I0) in Illinois! The project is being coordinated by the Havana Regional Airport Board and members of the local EAA Chapter 1420. RAF awarded grant funds to partially fund improvements at the airport. Additional improvements include year-round showers and a fire pit, for those who want to camp out and stay awhile.</p>



<p>Havana (9I0) is a unique 2,200’ grass airstrip in a small town located on the Illinois River. There is an abundance of wildlife and archeological remains from the early Mississippian culture. At night, the skies are pitch black. All of these resources have been brought to bear on the revitalization of 9I0. An annual migratory bird watching event and astronomy night now take place at Havana.  Each year brings more pilots, spontaneous visits and overnight camping.&nbsp;The picnic pavilion and additional improvements will serve visiting pilots who enjoy flying to new locations, especially those who enjoy quiet rural destinations.</p>

<p>Campground improvements at Fort&nbsp;Kent&nbsp;Municipal Airfield in Maine are now complete.&nbsp;Camping area additions include two picnic tables and a picnic area shelter just off the west side of the runway next to the trailhead to Fish River Falls. </p>



<p>Fort&nbsp;Kent&nbsp;Municipal Airfield is adjacent to Maine’s Fish River, and George Dumond of the Fish River Flying Club has spearheaded this round of improvements to the 2,154-ft airfield. An RAF grant helped cover costs for the project.<br>&nbsp;<br>“It has blossomed into a beautiful asset for recreational aviators in northern Maine,” RAF Liaison Andy Rowe said, promising, ”muskie downstream and brookies upstream of the falls, and a beautiful smooth grass strip with plenty of camping and friendly local folks.”</p>

<p>The RAF has granted funds to help cover the cost for improvements at <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;LQfCHBHuyGJjxjXJXOZV">Fort Kent Municipal Airfield</a> in Maine.&nbsp;Camping area additions will include two picnic tables and a picnic area shelter just off the west side of the runway next to the trailhead to Fish River Falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fort Kent Municipal Airfield is adjacent to Maine’s Fish River, and George Dumond of the Fish River Flying Club has spearheaded this round of improvements to the 2,154-ft airfield.</p>



<p>“It has blossomed into a beautiful asset for recreational aviators in northern Maine,” RAF Liaison Andy Rowe said, promising, ”muskie downstream and brookies upstream of the falls, and a beautiful smooth grass strip with plenty of camping and friendly local folks.”</p>



<p>Back in 2010, RAF Liaisons Steve Mason and Rowe obtained an RAF grant to help the Club maintain the field. “This is a Phoenix of an airport,” RAF New Hampshire Liaison John Meade said. “Steve and Andy helped reverse the demise of this airport,” he added. Dumond added his own note of appreciation, saying, “Thanks Andy for everything you continue to do to promote us and other airfields in the state!”</p>



<p>The Club will continue mowing the airfield and the area next to the shelter so visitors may fly in and park and camp next to the shelter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF appreciates this opportunity to cooperate with the Fish River Flying Club, George Dumond, Tommy Voisine and all the friendly folks in the St. John River Valley.<br>

<p>
<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DougTurnbull-300x209.jpg">Doug is a native of Bloomfield, NY, in the beautiful Finger Lakes. His father owned a Cessna 185 amphibian, and they would travel to Quebec, Canada on camping and fishing trips during the summer. Doug spent much of this time flying from the right seat. In 1983, he earned his private pilot license at the Penn Yan Flying Club; soon he found a 1947 PA12, which he purchased and flew for many years.</p>



<p>Doug continues to live in the same area in which he grew up, and it was there that he grew his firearm restoration business. The business gained a national reputation for the work they do. His daughter and son-in-law are currently in the process of taking over the business, which gives Doug additional time to fly and promote aviation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traveling the country in his current airplane – a 1946 PA12 with many Alaskan modifications&nbsp;–&nbsp;he attends events and gets acquainted with RAF liaisons and many RAF members. He has been to Trigger Gap in Arkansas numerous times as he crosses the country seeing clients.<br>
<br>“I am looking forward to promoting the recreational flying that is available in western and central New York state,” Doug says. “I hope to educate pilots about the exciting places there are to see, and experience, in my state.”</p>

<p>RAF grants are used typically to purchase building materials, with much of the labor provided by RAF volunteers. Occasionally professionals must be engaged to complete specialized tasks. When Montana’s Schafer Forest Service airstrip (8U2) needed serious grounds work this summer, RAF Montana Liaison Scott Newpower outlined the need, and an RAF grant was awarded for the project. The professionals required for this task was a team of mules and experienced mule skinners.<br>
<br>Schafer lies entirely within the Great Bear Wilderness Area, and as such, motorized equipment is not permitted. So in August, a team of mules was trailed in to plow and grade a 2,500-ft parallel turf runway that had fallen into disuse. The project reestablishes a proven management plan of two parallel turf runways. Using one runway for several years, then switching to the alternate, allows the “fallow” land to recover its health and natural appearance.<br>
<br>Teresa Byrd, reporter for the Pulitzer Prize-winning Hungry Horse News was on site during the work, covering the picturesque and anachronistic task.<br>
<br>Byrd reported, “The project . . . finally materialized this summer through the collaboration of the Forest Service, a group of volunteers, the Montana Pilots Association and the Recreational Aviation Foundation.” Byrd reported that Jeremy Rust, Wilderness Trails Manager for the Spotted Bear Ranger District; and Guy Zoellner, Wilderness Trails Manager for Big Prairie in the Bob Marshall Wilderness took on management of the project. “The two also recruited the help of volunteers Fred Flint and Colin Milone, both seasoned packers with decades of work experience for the Forest Service,” she added in her report. Newpower was in frequent contact with Forest Service personnel, and monitored the work as well. <br>
<br>Rust told Byrd that he appreciates the airstrip for the recreational possibilities it opens up for the public. “The airstrip allows this area of remote wilderness to become just another trailhead for recreators to base out of,” Rust is quoted as saying.<br>
<br>“If it requires a team of mules, we see that simply as part of airstrip improvement,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said. “I’m just glad I’m not the one spending all day in the dust behind a team of mules on a hot August day,” he added. <br>
<br>Byrd’s delightful story includes descriptions of the antique machinery, and how the fellows restored all of it for rugged service, in spite of quirks typical of hundred-year-old iron and wood. See her complete story <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hungryhorsenews.com/news/2020/sep/02/mules-old-equipment-help-rehab-wilderness-airstrip/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>Although the men behind the harness referred to the pair of mules as “Bella” and “Bull”, Scott continues to refer to the team as “Beech” and “Cessna.”<br>

<p>A West Virginia RAF member who owns the mountaintop grass airfield Rainelle, (WV30) has worked with RAF West Virginia Liaison Evan Davis to open it to RAF membership for fly-in camping.&nbsp;“There is no place in West Virginia that provides a facility like this that I am aware of,” Evan said.</p>



<p>In order to make it more appealing, the owner suggested building a shower house complete with men’s and women’s restrooms.&nbsp;Evan has secured an RAF grant to complete this improvement. “The owner offered his property, well and septic system, and will go through all the local permitting,” Evan reported,&nbsp;about the collaborative effort.</p>



<p>“This will allow people to experience camping with their airplanes in a peaceful setting with hot and cold running water and a nice restroom and shower facility,” Evan added.</p>



<p>The plan includes a concrete slab, fiberglass showers, toilets, sinks, hot water system, lumber, metal, roof, doors, and paint, with an allowance for miscellaneous costs.&nbsp;Volunteers will provide the labor at no cost. Evan hopes to announce the completed project next spring.</p>



<p>As a privately owned airfield, Evan pointed out that the owner graciously allowed it to be listed in the Airfield Guide. “We all know that it is easy to see places like this drop off the map if it is not getting used,” Evan said.  “The owners want to see it used in the future,”  he added.

<p>Silver Lake airfield (45S) is located in the Fremont-Winema National Forest in central Oregon.&nbsp;For the past several years, maintenance at the 3,000 x 55-ft runway had been neglected.&nbsp;“Earlier this year the Forest Service discussed closing and de-listing the airfield because it was considered unsafe and a liability risk,” RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes said. He contacted District Ranger Doug McKay and Unit Aviation Officer Chad Bergren with an approach to preserve the airfield.&nbsp;Richard made it clear that the recreational aviation community values remote airfields like Silver Lake, and that the RAF is willing to invest volunteer time and money toward their preservation.&nbsp;“It was agreed by all that improving the safety of the airfield would greatly reduce any potential liability,” he said. His proposal included volunteers clearing encroaching brush and repairing surface damage, at no cost to USFS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to Richard’s action, the USFS decided that Silver Lake was indeed an asset worth protecting.&nbsp;“As a result of our collaboration, brush removal and grading of the airfield surface has been recently completed, Richard reported, “and&nbsp;the surface is now in very good condition.” The RAF plans to provide and install a new windsock, and volunteers will clear brush from the parking area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be aware that 45S is located on private property leased by the USFS. Visitors may camp and explore, but open fires and the discharge of firearms are prohibited. “Please don’t do anything to offend the land owner, and avoid flying low over nearby ranches and the town of Silver Lake,” Richard said.  </p>

He received an RAF grant to extend the 2,100-foot long turf airfield an additional 1,300-1,500 feet to make it more accessible to GA pilots.&nbsp;The airfield will be lengthened and smoothed out in summer of 2021.</p>



<p>Cowboy’s Air Ranch Airport is in Washington County, called ”Sunrise County,” because as the easternmost point in the contiguous United States, the sun first rises here on the&nbsp;“Lower 48.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This airfield is privately owned, and permission is required prior to landing. Call Kenneth Winiarski at 207-538-7583. The airfield will also be closed for a logging operation for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>In March, the RAF reported that aviation weather cameras were in the works in Colorado, and now the official announcement is out. Thanks to a partnership between the Colorado Division of Aeronautics and the FAA’s Alaska Weather Camera Program, there are now four new aviation weather cameras functioning on the Division’s network of 13 Mountain AWOS sites, for a total of 52 cameras.&nbsp;Pilots can now visually observe&nbsp;weather conditions high&nbsp;in the Colorado Rockies, in addition to receiving accurate aviation weather information. See Colorado’s new aviation weather cameras here:&nbsp;<a href="https://weathercams.faa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://weathercams.faa.gov</a>. Click the green circles for camera views.</p>



<p>“This will be a significant safety improvement for aviators in Colorado, and we’re already in discussions with the FAA team about how we might expand this program to some of our mountain airports,”&nbsp;David Ulane, RAF supporter and CDOT Aeronautics Director said.</p>



<p>The FAA&nbsp;Weather Camera&nbsp;Program began in Alaska, providing visual weather in that state’s challenging environment.&nbsp;These 13 Colorado cameras are the first in the lower 48 to be incorporated into the FAA weather camera network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to current weather images, the FAA’s Weathercams website features comparisons to clear day views, and playback loops to ascertain weather trends. The FAA’s upgraded website also provides a variety of safety information, including METAR’s, TAF’s, pilot reports, and radar and satellite imagery.</p>

<p>RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller has announced that after more than forty years of disuse, the Rainy Mesa airstrip is now open for recreational use, after removal of encroaching trees.</p>



<p>“RAF Ambassador, and former State Liaison Larry Filener’s vision and dream to reopen Rainy Mesa airstrip is now a reality,” Ron said. He credits a great working relationship with the Gila National Forest – in particular with Reserve District Ranger John Pierson – as key in getting the approval to rehabilitate this 5,300-ft airstrip, which lies at an elevation of nearly 7,400 feet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between May and August, volunteers rehabilitated the strip, erected a windsock pole and runway end markings. They constructed a drag that will remain at the strip, made some test landings, and got the necessary approval to reopen it from the District Ranger and Forest Aviation Officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This has been a slow, methodical process involving the RAF, and New Mexico Pilot Association volunteers,” Ron said. The New Mexico Airstrip Network had developed and authored the Gila Airstrip Integrated Operations and Maintenance Plan for the Forest Service, which has facilitated projects like Rainy Mesa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find its Airfield Guide listing <a href="https://theraf.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=af2e34083d29a5e57b521a545&amp;id=0f4428d5a0&amp;e=d3acacabbe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Please call the Gila National Forest at 800-538-1644 for permission to land. </p>

<p>Alaska’s Tongass National Forest is the largest National Forest in the nation. There are 144 public use cabins in the Forest, accessible by boat, trail, seaplane, and wheeled aircraft. Twenty-six are accessed by flight only, and may be in jeopardy of closure. “These cabins are a true treasure in one of the most beautiful parts of the world,” RAF Director Jeff Russell said.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>Decreasing funding and the associated reduction of workforce has strained US Forest Service (USFS) resources, and the agency is examining ways to maximize return and reduce maintenance costs for these cabins, including decommissioning. To see the document “Sustainable Cabin Strategy, see:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd687218.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd687218.pdf</a>
<br>
<br>We are asking RAF members to provide input to the Forest Service to help preserve and prioritize work on the fly-in cabins. The Forest is receiving feedback from one Facebook group called&nbsp;<strong>
<em>Tongass National Forest Cabin Users</em>
</strong> showing 758 members as of this writing. So far, the comments favor hike-in, boat-in, and drive-in cabins.&nbsp;<strong>
<em>Almost no one spoke of fly-in as a choice</em>
</strong>.&nbsp;“It is feared that the fly-in only cabins may become low priority and subsequently removed. This would be a huge loss for the aviation community,” Russell added.<br>
<br>Some suggested an Adopt-a-cabin-type program, or partnering with non-profit entities to support cabin maintenance. The RAF has an established Memorandum of Understanding with the USFS, and this could be a very useful tool toward cabin preservation.<br>
<br>The Facebook Group is:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/235187413694818/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/groups/235187413694818/</a>

<p>Georgia RAF Ambassador Eric Davis reports that Creighton Island airfield now has a pair of runway cameras streaming video via separate YouTube channels.</p>



<p>At this time, Eric recommends bookmarking this link as the easiest way to tune into the two live webcams:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNRmOSzakItdbaHKSZChrw/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNRmOSzakItdbaHKSZChrw/videos</a>.</p>



<p>In order to not overwhelm the resident’s home Internet service, Eric rate-limited the HD cameras, but the resulting video quality is still useful, especially in conjunction with a look at the on-site weather station report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric installed&nbsp;a&nbsp;weather station just NW of the runway above the tree line, at a height of about 10 feet. “And capping it all off is the RAF emblazoned windsock,” he said. For current weather conditions go to:&nbsp;<a href="https://tempestwx.com/station/14385/grid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://tempestwx.com/station/14385/grid</a>&nbsp;or navigate to Georgia’s Creighton Island listing in the Airfield Guide. The drop down “Nearest WX” tab includes a link to the on-site weather station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric has agreed to document the equipment he used to assemble this station for anyone interested in doing something similar. “Until then, enjoy watching the cows on Creighton Island, or the effects of any regional hurricane,” he said.</p>



<p>Anyone desiring to fly in to Creighton Island during non-scheduled events MUST contact the owner 24 hours prior to arrival to obtain permission and a runway report. No landings are authorized outside of scheduled events unless you have spoken with the owner Frank Williams at 912-269-5194.</p>

<p>How do you mow the tall spring grass on&nbsp;Red’s Wallowa Horse Ranch airfield in Oregon’s Eagle Cap Wilderness –&nbsp;without&nbsp;the use of motorized equipment?</p>



<p>You trail in 20-year-olds Bird and Bat, who team up for the kind of job they know well. With just the right experience, these two mules – with Jim and Holly Akenson at the reins – completed the task on July 13, restoring the historic backcountry airfield to a suitable condition for use.</p>



<p>This publicly owned airfield, (6OR9) is managed by the US Forest Service and provides access to a spectacular recreation site, including fishing on the beautiful Minam River. For many years, the non-profit volunteer group Backcountry Horsemen of Oregon had graciously mowed the airfield. This spring, heavy rains brought on exceptionally high grass growth, which was a safety concern. RAF Oregon Liaison Richard&nbsp;Mayes&nbsp;took the initiative to apply for an RAF grant to cover mowing costs, and began looking into logistics.</p>



<p>A 1940s-era horse-drawn mower was on site and ready, thanks to Dick Walker, Backcountry Horsemen volunteer, who has maintained the equipment for many years. RAF Oregon Ambassador Bill Ables secured the mule team and operators, airlifted the harnesses and gear in and out, and&nbsp;physically helped in the mowing all day long, providing invaluable assistance.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Inspecting-the-mower.jpeg">



<p>The RAF, Oregon Pilots Assoc., Idaho Aviation Assoc., and the USFS collaborated to ensure a valuable public asset was preserved through good old-fashioned teamwork.</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve already seen the gem of an airstrip called Ryan Field near Glacier Park, Montana, and know about the RAF’s vision to “raise the barn.” Thanks to the response from generous donors from across the country, our plans are coming together!<br>
<br>When Ben and Agnes “Butchie” Ryan first saw the tamarack, pine and cedar timbered 160-acres at the foot of Strawberry Mountain, they knew they would be happy there. It was 1967, and Ben – veteran Army P-38 pilot – imagined his own airfield, and Butchie, veteran Army nurse, pictured views of glorious sunrises and sunsets.&nbsp;<em>Their remarkable story is here:&nbsp;</em>
<a href="https://theraf.org/ryan-field/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://theraf.org/ryan-field/</a>
</p>




<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ben-Ryan-2.jpg">
<p>Ben built that 2,500-ft airstrip, and the RAF was introduced to Ryan’s place in 2003. The couple appreciated the RAF mission and Ryans donated the property to the RAF so that aviators and their family and friends could enjoy the airstrip. Ryan Field inspires those seeking a backcountry environment to land and enjoy Montana’s spectacular Glacier Country. It provides access to the best of the mountain West, but more important, it is a place to gather, a place to build community and to be a model for others that could follow. With a deep respect for the Ryan legacy, the RAF is building on the foundation that Ben and Butchie laid. Ben and Butchie provided not only vision and the property, but dollars to sustain it.</p>




<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">We have committed to this project.</h2>

Along with a team of engineers based in Silicon Valley, she is growing a start-up that is building an electric aircraft that will help first responders get to the scene of an accident in remote areas quicker and safer.</p>



<p>A former aerobatic competition pilot, she now flies her modified Piper Colt all over the West.</p>



<p>Katerina&nbsp;is excited to spread the word about the RAF’s mission to the GA community and beyond, encouraging people to use aviation as a sustainable way to get in touch with the great outdoors.</p>



<p>She is passionate about how aviation facilitates public land access, exploration, and adventure. She hopes that as more people discover the freedom of aviation, they grow a deeper connection to our land.<br>

<p>
<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HarperGoodwinnewphoto-225x300.jpg">In eighth grade, Harper’s dad gave him a book, <em>How to Become an Airline Pilot</em>, then career day in high school “sealed the deal,” Harper says. “The job was described to me as something like, ‘Fly around the world in fast moving jets with lots of levers, knobs, gauges and important procedures, while wearing a cool uniform and hat, and, oh yes, with beautiful single women’. I was 17 and asked my dad, “Why isn’t <em>everyone</em> an airline pilot?”</p>



<p>Four years later Harper flew out of Louisiana Tech University with 500 hours and a degree in Professional Aviation, and went to work for a one-airplane company that didn’t make it, but, “I was lucky enough to spend 37 years doing exactly what I wanted to do, all the while trying very hard not to fly close to anything that wasn’t real long, real wide and pretty damn flat,” he said.</p>



<p>In retirement Harper bought a Cessna 210 to fly between home in Fort Worth, and property in NW Arkansas. A presentation by then-RAF Arkansas Liaison Dave Myrick about the RAF building a new airfield piqued his interest. “Well, the 210 rolled out of the hangar, and in came the Cessna 180,” Harper said, thinking, “This should be no problem, with my 20,000 hours of flying time – at least two hours in a taildragger about 40 years ago.” He goes on to explain, “Interesting to say the least. We all know how entertaining PIO’s (pilot induced oscillations) are to watch. For the rest of the story, just ask around.”</p>



<p>Harper now happily flies his 180, with a passion for backcountry flying and the RAF’s role in its promotion. “I have found it to be a great and worthy cause involving exceptional people,” Harper says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He and his wife Diane, their dog Lulu and two cats live in the woods three miles from that new Arkansas airfield, Trigger Gap.</p>



<p>Harper can be reached at <a href="mailto:hgoodwin@theraf.org">hgoodwin@theraf.org</a>.</p>]]>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Reds-Horse-Ranch-USFS-HQ.jpg">



<p>Red’s Wallowa Horse Ranch is within&nbsp;Oregon’s&nbsp;Eagle Cap Wilderness, administered by the US Forest Service.&nbsp;There is no road to the 1,600-ft airstrip, so access is only by aircraft, foot, or horseback.</p>



<p>“This location is attractive for remote camping and hiking, and fishing on the adjacent Minam River can be particularly rewarding,” said&nbsp;Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes. His concern is that&nbsp;without mowing,&nbsp;the airstrip could become unusable and likely lost to future use.&nbsp;He has been awarded an RAF grant to mow the 1,600-ft airstrip and tackle brush removal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Situated within a designated Wilderness Area, mechanized equipment is prohibited. For the past several years, a volunteer has trailed in livestock and non-motorized equipment&nbsp;to undertake the mowing. This dedicated, 82-year-old volunteer&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue to participate and provide the equipment, but Richard has organized additional help. A new “mule driver” will take up the reins under the watchful eyes of the seasoned veteran.</p>



<p>Hand tools&nbsp;will be used&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove hawthorn and brush infesting the airstrip and the camping areas.&nbsp;RAF Ambassador Bill Ables will coordinate the mowing with USFS representatives,&nbsp;who are currently managing manual weed control efforts.</p>



<p>“It takes most of a day to mobilize and walk the mules and gear into Red’s,” Richard observed. He hopes the mowing can be completed in one day, but a hot day could vex the mules and slow things down, followed by another day to trail everything back out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The project also demonstrates our willingness to collaborate with USFS and to donate our time, money and labor to protect backcountry access,” Richard said.</p>

<p>RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller reports that after years of cooperative effort with the New Mexico Airstrip Network, “we convinced the BLM that Cuba Airstrip could be a valuable asset for them as well as a recreational asset for aviation.” This BLM-owned airstrip had been used for sagebrush spraying, but had fallen into disrepair with ruts, cattle tracks, and erosion on the runway surface.</p>



<p>The 3,800-ft airstrip lies at an elevation of 6,798 feet and appeals to recreational pilots because the Continental Divide Trail runs adjacent to the airstrip.</p>



<p>RAF Director Emeritus Rol Murrow joined Ron, outgoing NMPA President Joyce Woods, and others on the planning/steering committee, and they started meeting with the BLM field office responsible for the airstrip.</p>



<p>“Rol developed an improvement plan for future amenities; members of the Airstrip Network created a maintenance and operations plan; New Mexico Aviation Division offered funding and technical work; and New Mexico Pilots Association and the RAF provided technical guidance. This has been a total team effort,”&nbsp; Ron said, with a nod to RAF California Liaison Rick Lach for suggestions on how to best motivate the BLM toward the goal of reclaiming the strip for public use.</p>



<p>Phase 1 is nearly complete, the strip was graded, and FAA registration and charting is in progress. More work is planned, but for now the airstrip is useable. See <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;oUkytJIpTglQcbEoqyCk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield.Guide</a> for details.</p>



<p>“I want to thank Rol for his vision, Joyce Woods for her support, and all the members of the NM Airstrip Network planning committee,” Ron said.</p>

<p>RAF Washington Liaison Dave Whitelaw was awarded an RAF grant for airfield maintenance and campsite construction at Avey Field (69S) in Laurier, WA. This 1,975-ft gravel runway is near a bend in the Kettle River, 35 nm NNE of Colville, WA. The airstrip is privately owned, but open for public use.<br>
<br>Dave’s campsite project includes creating a camping area, adding an outhouse, fire pits and picnic tables. Encroaching trees will be felled, bucked, split and left for firewood, and the windsock will be relocated and replaced. <br>
<br>Avey Field is unique in that its north-south runway actually crosses the Washington/British Columbia border, and Customs are available on the highway to the west. US-based aircraft should park on the US (south) side of the ramp; Canadian aircraft are asked to park on the north side.</p>

<p>RAF Minnesota Liaison Kurt Pennuto received word from&nbsp;Dave Retka, president of the Isle Airport Association, (IAA) that the city council voted to keep the Isle airport, (MY72) open. “I want to thank everyone for their hard work, letters of support and commitment to keeping Isle Airport open for future generations of pilots,” Kurt said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Isle airport is listed on the charts as private. The IAA operates the airport with donations and membership dues, and some fundraising. At this time, the airport will remain private, and not seek “Public” status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is work yet to do at Isle, but with the recent vote, this airport will remain open and the future looks positive,” Kurt said, adding, “For now, I can assure you that yours and everyone’s grassroots effort in support of saving Isle airport has been a success.” He pointed out that the RAF worked along with AOPA, MN Pilots Association, and others; with additional leverage from the many letters of support from individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is great news,” RAF President Bill McGlynn said. “Congratulations and thanks to everyone for responding to the RAF Call to Action. These efforts oftentimes shift the balance and opinions&nbsp;of elected leadership and this is proof,” Bill added.</p>]]>

<p>Ohio’s Noble County Airport, (I10) lies within Wolf Run State Park, 64 nm ESE of Columbus. The fly-in only campground, situated on a beautiful lake, “is the only such destination in Ohio,” RAF Ohio Liaison Christine Mortine said. She was impressed with its recreational opportunities, and in April was granted funds for two equipment carts and an RAF fire ring to add to the two existing fire rings. <br>
<br>“The Wolf Run Fly In Camp Area has proven to be a highly energized project with mounting support and enthusiasm,” Christine said, leading to Phase Two improvements with what she calls “full throttle involvement” of the Noble County Board of Trustees, Noble County Commissioner, Ohio State Parks Ohio Department of Natural Resources, and RAF.<br>
<br>Thanks to RAF grant funds, construction will begin for a Pilot Shelter/Storage Room near the camp area to provide cover for picnic tables and storage for carts, kayak paddles, lifejackets, and bikes. At least three wooden tent platforms will be added. The outhouses will be improved, and the tie-down area will be graded for proper drainage. She also budgeted for the installation of a camp visitor registration box. “The portion of the campground on the airport side is beautifully private,” she said. <br>
<br>The project should be completed by August. See <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/73560953-6de7-41f9-a027-72674a1c69b8/overview?searchQuery=noble+county">airfield.guide</a> for information.  </p>]]>

<p>RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes was granted funds toward maintenance at McKenzie Bridge Airport, (00S) in the Willamette National Forest.</p>



<p>“McKenzie Bridge Airport is popular with recreational aviators,” Mayes said. “It provides access to the McKenzie River, McKenzie River Mountain Bike Trail, and remote camping.”</p>



<p>The RAF observes pandemic recommendations, and this project differs from the typical volunteer-led approach. Instead of organizing a work party to tackle seasonal maintenance together, the grant will provide for a contractor to mow and manage brush during the growing season for safe operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF supports the State of Oregon in maintaining this appealing recreational destination. “For the past three years we have held at least two volunteer work parties each year to perform maintenance and improvements at the airport,” Mayes said. This year, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and prohibitions on large group gatherings, no volunteer work parties are planned.</p>



<p>Regardless of how the work is accomplished, Mayes says, “The project supports our mission to preserve and maintain airstrips for recreational access.”</p>

<p>Tres&nbsp;Clinton&nbsp;is a proud graduate of the University of Oklahoma, earning his B.S. in Aviation Management.&nbsp;He began flying in 2004, with the goal of becoming an airline pilot. “Landing a Super Cub for the first time, my path was altered,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Owner of C3 Air flight school in&nbsp;Burnet, TX,&nbsp;Tres&nbsp;instructs for tailwheel and seaplane endorsements in partnership with Promark Aviation and Tac Aero.</p>




<p>“I enjoy the adventure of this facet of aviation, and working with people who share a passion for stick and rudder flying,” he says. Already an enthusiast of recreation and aviation, the RAF was a natural fit for&nbsp;Tres. He’s also a member of AOPA, the Society of Aviation Flight Educators (SAFE), and the Seaplane Pilot Association.</p>



<p>Tres&nbsp;and his family live in the small Texas Hill Country town of&nbsp;Burnet. There he enjoys giving his two small children rides in the “Yellow Airplane,” and spending time with his beautiful wife Caity.&nbsp;Tres&nbsp;works primarily from the&nbsp;Burnet&nbsp;Airport (KBMQ), and invites you to stop by if you’re ever in the area 44 nm northwest of Austin International.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RagerAirfieldOregon-1024x768.jpg">



<p>The RAF and the US Forest Service (USFS) have collaborated to make improvements to the primitive airstrip adjacent to the Rager Ranger Station.&nbsp;Located in the Ochoco National Forest in Central Oregon, the Rager Ranger Station served as the administrative site for the Paulina Ranger District for over 105 years.&nbsp; Administration of the ranger station was relocated to Prineville in 2013, but the 2,800-ft airstrip remains a popular destination for backcountry pilots.</p>



<p>Since closure of the ranger station, the Rager airstrip had become hazardous due to encroaching brush, surface damage caused by wildlife and livestock, and disappearance of the windsock. Following consultations with USFS District Ranger Johanna Kovarik and Botanist Jill Welborn, it was agreed that the RAF would undertake the badly needed safety improvements.</p>



<p>With an RAF grant, Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes coordinated removal of brush on the airstrip, the turn-arounds at each end, the aircraft parking area, and a six-foot swath along each side of the 25-ft wide airstrip.</p>



<p>The surface damage was repaired; and a new windsock pole, frame and windsock were supplied and erected. Trash and debris were removed and a new stone fire ring was constructed near a donated picnic table in the camping area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Particular thanks must be expressed to RAF members Jim Campbell and Ed Stryker for their exceptional dedication to the project,” Richard said.</p>

<p>RAF Idaho Liaison&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;Riley reports that the improvements to the airport camping facility at Driggs Airport, (KDIJ) are ready for use. The project was a collaborative effort between the RAF, the Idaho Aviation Association, (IAA), the City of Driggs, and its Airport Board. Thanks to financial support from each, a 12′ x 16′ cedar pilot shelter, potable water, porta-potty, power and a charging station were installed at a nice grass tie-down area with views of the nearby Teton Range. More upgrades are planned such as a fire ring and gas barbecue, and more permanent toilet facilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>Driggs also has a grass runway parallel to the paved runway. “It is a great stop on the way to or from the Idaho backcountry,”&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;said. He points out that the Warbirds Cafe is just a short walk from the campground. An IAA&nbsp;bike shed and loaner bikes are available to ride into town. The airport has rental cars to access the amenities the area has to offer. “It’s a great destination for the pilot community, with access to hiking, biking, fishing, floating, golf and a small town with numerous shops and restaurants,”&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;said, adding, “The project is well aligned with the RAF mission of using aircraft to access recreational resources.”&nbsp;<br>

<p>After family, service to community is Bill&nbsp;Ables’ next driving thought and motivation. He was raised in Pendleton, OR and graduated from Oregon State University as a Wildlife Biologist in 1973. He always loved the idea of flying, and earned his pilot license in 1975; but was drawn to a career in public service in the wild lands and waters of his native state.</p>



<p>Bill obtained training at the state police academy. This landed him a job as a backcountry game warden in the desert country of southeast Oregon. He made friends with the Basque sheepherders, and they developed mutual respect for him, as well. But he longed for the forests he grew up in, and in 1976 was assigned to Wallowa County, headquartered in Enterprise, in northeast Oregon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There wasn’t a stoplight in the whole county,” he says. But it wasn’t a sleepy region. The job exposed him to homicides, car wrecks, all kinds of police work and fish and wildlife enforcement. The remote Hells Canyon National Recreation Area was his “office”, including the Snake River Canyon, the deepest canyon in North America – yes, deeper than Grand Canyon. “There were times we had to depend on a rancher’s radio phone, since we had no other way to communicate,” he said. His job required the use of horses, drift boats, kayaks, and a jet boat to patrol 102 miles of the Snake River in Hells Canyon. Referring to the end of his professional career, he said, “that last ride on the river was as exciting as my first in 1976.”</p>



<p>For twelve years, Bill served on the school board. He and his wife Judy are now retired; she taught elementary grades.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, Bill became aware of the need to protect airstrips, saying, “we lost a couple of airstrips, and I got involved.” He is the Oregon Pilots’ Association Backcountry Committee Chairman, and Idaho Aviation Association, (IAA) District II Director. He is a frequent volunteer at work parties in eastern Oregon and western Idaho, most recently working on horse-drawn mowing operations, flying in Sakcrete and digging holes for windsocks.</p>



<p>It was a natural fit for Bill to join the RAF. He became aware that airstrips were overlooked in the Wallowa-Whitman Forest Revision Plan, and reached out to RAF Public Agency Consultant Ron Normandeau for some mentoring. He received an RAF orange shirt in the mail, and attended a hearing. The USFS delegate from Washington, DC saw him and exclaimed to Bill, “I recognize that shirt!”</p>



<p>Since then, Bill has become an RAF ambassador. He gives the Idaho Aviation Association and Oregon Pilots Association high marks for leadership on projects in cooperation with the RAF and its grant program.</p>

<p>RAF Idaho Liaison Tim Riley’s RAF grant was approved for camping amenities at Driggs-Reed Memorial Airport (KDIJ), located in eastern Idaho at the base of the beautiful Grand Teton Mountains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Driggs is a world class destination for the pilot community, with access to hiking, biking, fishing, floating, golf and a small town with numerous shops and restaurants.” Riley said. “Teton Aviation located on the field is a full service FBO including a great restaurant and a collection of Warbirds in the adjacent museum.”</p>



<p>As an active member of the Driggs airport board, Tim began pursuing the dream of an airport campground to serve the pilot community a year ago. Persistent education and discussion with all stakeholders has paid off as the project has approval to move forward.</p>



<p>The airport camping project is a collaborative effort between the RAF, the&nbsp;Idaho Aviation Association, (IAA), the City of Driggs, and the Driggs Airport Board. A cedar pavilion will provide shelter and amenities include a picnic table, barbecue, fire ring, electricity, water, and a port-a-potty. Pilots will also have access to bicycles provided by the IAA Borrow-A-Bike program.</p>



<p>“For pilots seeking an overnight stop en route to the Idaho and Montana backcountry, this is camping with a view of the Grand Tetons and access to food, supplies and fuel,” Riley said.&nbsp;In addition to being a camping destination, the&nbsp;campground will be available for clubs or other group fly-ins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This project is well-aligned with the RAF mission of using aircraft to access recreational resources,” Riley said. “It also has the potential to be a base camp or an outpost for the RAF goals of creating regional flying locations with high recreational value,” he added.</p>



<p>Riley projects the completion date for this summer.</p>

<p>RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller was awarded an RAF grant to lengthen the crosswind runway at Amigos del Cielo airport, (NM90) near Rodeo, NM.</p>



<p>The grant provides funds for the airport manager to reclaim the crosswind runway to its original length of 1,900 feet, with expected completion by the end of May.</p>



<p>The crosswind runway had become overgrown, essentially reducing it by 500 feet,&nbsp;which was a safety concern. “This will allow pilots, especially those with tailwheel aircraft, a safer option during windy days, a common occurrence in the area,” Keller said. Keller constructed and placed new windsock poles at this airport using a previous RAF grant.</p>



<p>“The manager is a pilot and aircraft owner, and wants to increase utilization of this recreational aviation asset,” Keller said. Amigos del Cielo has unique facilities including camping, lodging, hangars, and a movie theater.&nbsp;Non-pilots stay at the lodging to bird watch and star gaze.&nbsp;Keller hopes that a weekend fly-in will become an annual event in late February of each year.</p>



<p>It’s not the highest recreational flying destination in New Mexico, but with a name that literally means, “Friends of the Sky,” it sounds like a great place to experience.</p>



<p>Amigos del Cielo is listed in the Airfield Guide as a permissive airstrip. See  <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/326ff814-7ddf-4156-9c9d-7eda7bf1f9ea/overview?searchQuery=amig">Airfield Guide</a>

<p>RAF Vermont Liaison Robert Burley was awarded an RAF grant to keep Allenholm, (VT26) open for public use. This 2,000 x 40-ft turf airfield lies in a working apple orchard on an island in Lake Champlain, between Vermont and New York mountain ranges. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Multiple and varied water, hiking, camping and scenic recreational opportunities abound,” Burley said.&nbsp;There is a B&amp;B on the field, and&nbsp;bicycles are available. Less than a half mile away is a quaint Vermont village, Allenholm farm store, famous for its pies and pastries; a renowned bistro, craft shops, and the ferry to New York State.&nbsp;Within a mile is a Lake Champlain state park with beaches and watercraft rentals.&nbsp;A particularly wonderful experience is walking or biking on the former railroad causeway crossing more than two miles of open Lake Champlain, which is a 100mile long lake.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“The field has a 50-year history of use for instruction, fly-ins, local social events, weddings and island recreational access,” Burley said, adding, “RAF involvement has led to a regional resurgence in use, and remaining open will preserve these uses.”</p>



<p>The airfield owner and the airfield enjoy strong local and regional support, and a conservation easement is in place with Vermont Land Trust specifying agriculture and/or aviation use for the property. To preserve the airfield adequately, Burley applied for RAF grant money to rebuild the existing mower, provide for seasonal mowing, and improve the existing open bay hangar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Allenholm is the ideal field from which to stage regional day trips to other grass fields in the scenic mountains and islands. There are trout streams, a four star, 150 year-old premier lakeside resort, golf course are within a short flight,” Burley said,&nbsp;“or for extended peaceful respite.”&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TaxCode2.jpg">



<p>How can anyone that is not an accountant, or financial planner keep up on all that goes on with the tax code, let alone the Cares Act? John McKenna received this message from RAF Ambassador Rick Mercil and we thought it was worth sharing. No matter who your favorite charity is, you may want to take advantage of this opportunity. (see below)</p>



<p>Hi John,</p>



<p>I just finished my 1<sup>st</sup> read of the CARES Act related to the COVID 19 issue.</p>



<p>These times are certainly creating difficulty for some, but charitable organizations like the RAF can benefit from this new legislation. Some of our donor friends may not be aware of this opportunity to help the RAF this year and get a tax advantage.</p>



<p>Let me briefly explain how it works:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There is a new $300 tax deduction&nbsp;“above-the-line” adjustment for non-itemizing tax payers (about 90% of taxpayers) who had lost the tax incentive to donate. It is $600 for married couples.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Those who do itemize can still itemize, and get benefit as well.</em>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Required Minimum Distributions are not going to be required to be taken from IRA’s and other qualified plans this year, (2020) yet you can still gift up to $100,000 from those plans to charities of your choice without it being considered income.</li>
</ul>



<p>These new rules can benefit donors who would like to assist the RAF, and are in a position to do so. There is no assurance this will be carried forward past 2020, so if this might fit you and your situation this is the year.</p>



<p>Regards,</p>



<p>Rick Mercil</p>



<p>The RAF appreciates Rick’s professional observations, and recommend you consult your tax preparer for ways the CARES Act can make donations easier for you, as well as applicability to your situation.</p>

<p>RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes has taken on another project. He would like to see the primitive airstrip at the Rager Creek Ranger Station in the Ochoco National Forest included in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.airfield.guide/" target="_blank">Airfield Guide</a>. But first, a number of safety improvements need to be completed. “The airstrip is very remote, located in the Central Oregon high-desert, offering a quiet place to picnic or overnight camp. There are also several historic buildings at the Ranger Station that were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps” Mayes said.</p>



<p>Documented activity in this
area goes back to Hudson Bay trappers, the John Fremont Expedition, 1855 Indian
Treaties, homesteading, and the eventual establishment of the Paulina District
Ranger Station that remained active for 105 years.</p>



<p>Collaborating with USFS
environmental and cultural teams, Mayes has gotten agreement from the District
Ranger to complete the necessary work. In early March, his project was approved
for an RAF grant to cover equipment and material costs. Mayes has organized
local RAF volunteers who are ready to help out, when prudent, and a local
landowner has offered the use of his equipment.</p>



<p>The project includes removing brush that’s encroaching on the airstrip; repair of surface damage from rodents and livestock; clearing an aircraft parking and camping area; and installation of a new windsock pole and windsock.</p>



<p>“The project helps to ensure this unique backcountry airstrip remains in service by improving safety, and by strengthening our partnership with USFS,” Mayes said. </p>

</p>
<p>Ray Ballantyne was born into an aviator family as his father was a WWII CG-4A Combat Glider pilot who met his mother at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, TX while she was training to be a WASP (Women Airforce Service Pilot). Ray earned his pilot’s license before he got his driver’s license. “I thought I was cool in high school giving friends airplane rides,” he says.</p>
<p>He was hired by the FAA as an Air Traffic Control (ATC) specialist in 1977 and assigned to the small Flight Service Station in Cut Bank, Montana. His first flight into Schafer Meadows, MT the summer of 1979 started a lifelong love of backcountry flying. His 34 year ATC career included several towers in Alaska – Bethel, Fairbanks, Anchorage and Merrill – while also doing some part time commercial air taxi flying at Bethel and Fairbanks; and Colorado Springs. Moving from Alaska in 2000, he was the Terminal Hub Manager for Oregon working at the Portland ATCT/TRACON. </p>
<p>After a stint in the Regional office in Seattle, he served as the Quality Assurance manager for Los Angeles ARTCC. Leaving there for duty at the national FAA Headquarters in DC, he finished his career as Senior Advisor to the Western Service Area Terminal Director in Seattle.</p>
<p>A couple of unusual air traffic assignments placed Ray on a Coast Guard cutter in Prince William Sound, and on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez during the 1989 oil spill. During Alaska’s Iditarod Sled Dog Race he conducted temporary ATC at the Skwentna checkpoint.</p>
<p>“My wife Lisa and I are actively retired at our hangar-home in Sequim, Washington, and enjoy flying our GlaStar to magical airstrips around the Washington, Oregon and Idaho areas,” Ray says. Lisa serves the RAF as a VP of Appreciation. Ray is active with golf, his local EAA 430 chapter, and now has stepped up to join Dave Whitelaw as an RAF Washington State Liaison.</p>
<p>Ray can be reached at <a href="mailto:rballantyne@theraf.org">rballantyne@theraf.org.</a>

<p>Beginning this spring, cameras will
be added to 13 Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS) in mountainous areas
to help VFR pilots. The official FAA announcement states:&nbsp;</p>



<p>These cameras will build on the
success of a&nbsp;<a href="https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDQuMTgxNzA5ODEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWEuZ292L2Fib3V0L29mZmljZV9vcmcvaGVhZHF1YXJ0ZXJzX29mZmljZXMvYXRvL3NlcnZpY2VfdW5pdHMvc3lzdGVtb3BzL2ZzL2FsYXNrYW4vd2VhdGhlcl9jYW1zLyJ9.Yy0dA1Ju_eEs23Ow8p8eIOysYb6ZIRZMtyCZ6PfMUQs/br/75653672990-l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20-year-old program in Alaska</a>&nbsp;that
has improved safety by providing near-real-time video to pilots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Images are updated every 10 minutes
and “have been critical to help pilots make better safety decisions,” according
to the FAA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These Colorado cameras will be the first FAA Weather Cameras
outside of Alaska. Soon, pilots planning to fly in the Colorado Rockies will be
able to see real-time weather, in addition to the accurate weather information
they receive from AWOS. The&nbsp;<a href="https://avcams.faa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAA’s weather camera website</a>&nbsp;will
display still images that each camera captures.</p>



<p>The FAA will assist the state with the camera installations, then the state will own and maintain the cameras.</p>

<p>Marcy Field, (1I1) is a 2,390 x 95-ft grass strip in the Adirondack Mountains in Keene, New York. Assistant Airport Manager Bob Rose reached out to the RAF to consider some needed airfield improvements.</p>



<p>RAF New Hampshire Liaison John Meade is familiar with the airfield, and describes some of the recreational opportunities that are accessible from it. “There is world class fly fishing in the Ausable River across the road, and the local outfitter ‘The Mountaineer’ is a mile down the road for all needs as well as guide services,” he added. Uber and Lyft provide service to restaurants and hotels within three miles; and transportation to the Olympic Village at Lake Placid.&nbsp;Adirondack Rock and River Guide Service&nbsp;is located at the start of the famous Jackrabbit ski trail and will pick up and drop off pilots staying in the lodge. The Town of Keene will provide transportation to The Garden, a point with several trailheads where camping is allowed 150 feet from the trails.</p>



<p>Over the years, trees have grown in on the approach end of Runway 20. An RAF grant was awarded for the needed improvements. The Town of Keene will cooperate by providing equipment and manpower. After a professional tree company removes the trees, local volunteers known as the Adirondack Aviators Group will help town employees do the hand work to remove brush and clean-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Work is expected to begin this Spring once the ground has dried up, and the project should be completed within a couple of weeks. Check <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/2144a097-2213-47a2-9ec2-a73dc1bbab1d/overview?searchQuery=marcy">Airfield.Guide</a> for updates.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/airfield-guide-mock-up.jpg">



<p>The idea of an airfield guide came about in response to repeated requests for a comprehensive listing of recreational places to fly. Created in cooperation between the RAF and Tailwind Aviation Foundation, all of the work is provided by volunteers.&nbsp;With its genesis in Arkansas, it began with a majority of Arkansas recreational airfields. RAF member and supporter Chip Gibbons began writing code and with the help of RAF Arkansas Liaison Dave Powell and others, began adding airfields and beta testing the program. They created a comprehensive survey form and RAF state liaisons were tasked with sending in appropriate airfields for consideration. Once the information is verified the location is added.&nbsp;<br> <br>It’s free to use, and once you’ve created a user registration, you receive updates of the new fields as they are added. See&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://airfield.guide/" target="_blank">airfield.guide</a>&nbsp;to register.&nbsp;<br>
<br>The Airfield.Guide home page states, “New places. New adventures,” and as of this writing, the site lists 231 airports, with 56 in Arkansas; Missouri is second highest with 18; Montana third with 17; Oregon comes next with 15, followed by Oklahoma with 14. As advertised, the geographic region has grown – 49 of 50 states are now represented – with more recreational airstrips and airfields added all the time.&nbsp;Airstrips are defined as two types, Permissive (green), where users don’t need to ask for permission; and Conditional (yellow), where a condition needs to be met before use, such as&nbsp;a required Safety Briefing; or prior contact with owner.&nbsp;These are clearly defined in the Airfield.Guide.</p>



<p>You’ll find the many features of the Airfield.Guide very helpful in planning your flight. You can sort by recreational amenities (camping, restrooms, fishing, cell service, etc), runway length, region, state or RHI, Relative Hazard Index, where full airstrip surveys have been completed, (RHI is based on Galen Hanselman’s rating system). Many airstrips include photos, and even videos of approaches and landings. The “Manage Tour” feature can be used to plan a flight of several locations, email it to fellow pilots, then all can upload to ForeFlight for navigation to those strips. Additionally, you’ll find the basics, lat/long, elevation, ownership, pattern direction and CTAF.&nbsp;<strong>
<em>Going forward,</em>
</strong>&nbsp;<strong>
<em>The Airfield.Guide is also where you’ll find important Safety Briefings developed for specific airstrips, some of which are required to be reviewed prior to landing</em>
</strong>&nbsp;and again, details to gain knowledge to help you make appropriate decisions before you fly there.<br> <br>RAF President Bill McGlynn said, “This is an important focus for us in 2020. We would like to double the number of airfields in the Airfield.Guide.”</p>



<p>The RAF thanks the Tailwind Aviation Foundation, Powell, Gibbons and each state liaison for contributing potential airstrips.</p>

<p>In May and September of 2019 the RAF organized volunteer work
parties to clean and improve the campground and erect a gazebo adjacent to
Montana’s West Yellowstone Airport (KWYS). “It has easy access for all levels
of pilots and is a good airport and campground to get your feet wet in
backcountry flying,” RAF Montana Liaison Scott Newpower said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF was recently approached by West Yellowstone’s airport
manager and Montana Aeronautics about helping to provide two $1,100 picnic
tables similar to those flown in and constructed at Schafer Meadows, (8U2) last
year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF awarded a grant to share the cost equally between
Montana Pilots Association and MT Aeronautics. MT Aeronautics will deliver the
tables to West Yellowstone. The tables are expected to be ready for use by June
1, one of which will be wheelchair accessible. Airport Manager Jeff Kadlec
estimates that during the season, between one hundred to one hundred and fifty
people have used the area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These tables will finish off the gazebo area of the campground
and make West Yellowstone’s campground one of the best in Montana,” Newpower
said. Pilots are welcome to enjoy this beautiful campground for day and
overnight use.</p>



<p>West Yellowstone Airport is paved and lies at an elevation of 6,649 feet. It is open seasonally, and closes mid-October through early May. Pilots are to check NOTAMS or may call 406-459-9825, or 406-646-7631 for specific conditions. The airport is listed in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp?892;OjyuyPiokfVTfxagRZEW" target="_blank">Airfield.Guide.</a>

<p>Arkansas’s Trigger Gap
airfield, (17A) was restocked on Valentine’s weekend with plenty of firewood,
split and ready for each of the two firepits within the camping areas. RAF
supporter Harper Goodwin and his wife Dianne live near the field, and hosted a
crew of RAF volunteers to clean up their front yard of downed trees, creating
firewood for the camping areas. The project was encouraged by Dianne, who, it
was rumored, was looking for a garden area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participating in the
project were the Goodwins, Chip Gibbons, Craig Gourley, Greg Matteri and his
wife Debbie, and RAF Arkansas Liaison Dave Powell and his wife Julie. “Dianne
fed us a great lunch which made it all worth it, and Trigger is now full of
wood,” Powell said.</p>

<p>Alton Bay New Hampshire, B18 is located on the southern edge of Lake Winnipesaukee, the largest Lake in New Hampshire. It is the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;FAA sanctioned public Ice Runway with designator in the lower 48 states. “Come land on the frozen lake and get your Ice Wings and Ice Chip,” RAF New Hampshire Liaison John Meade says.&nbsp;Pilots eager to practice this New England tradition come from as far as New Jersey and the New England states.</p>



<p>The RAF has been a key supporter these past few years keeping this tradition alive, and again in 2020 Meade applied and was awarded a $1,250 grant toward operations. The grant boosts donations from New Hampshire Pilots Association, local pilots and a Maine FBO all motivated to keep the ice field plowed, as long as the ice holds up, typically through March.<br>  <br>NH Department of Transportation pays Paul LaRoche a small stipend toward his time and truck to plow, and other volunteers get involved to keep the ice field open. “Paul hosts a pizza party at the end of the season for his volunteers as a way of saying thank you,” Meade added.</p>

<p>Backcountry airstrips serve as trailheads—jumping off points for backcountry adventures. Included in this post are photos of Joshua and Caleb Turner returning (with dad) to their airplane at Benchmark (3U7) airfield in Montana, in the Lewis and Clark National Forest. Along with their father, Pennsylvania State Liaison Andy Turner, Josh and Caleb used the airstrip and associated campground to stage a four day, 44-mile hike into the Bob Marshall and Scapegoat Wilderness areas. They climbed peaks along the continental divide, fished the streams, and saw country of spellbinding beauty. Josh and Caleb are already planning a “return to the Scapegoat” for summer 2020, and they can testify that backcountry airstrips like Benchmark provide access that makes wilderness travels like this possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) and Death Valley
National Park officially signed a five-year cooperative maintenance agreement
for the Chicken Strip in Saline Valley. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),
dated October 18, also renews the established maintenance agreement at Furnace
Creek Airport and Stovepipe Wells Airstrip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The RAF has proven that this partnership works since our
original 2008 MOU,” RAF Chairman John McKenna said. “The National Park Service
recognizes us as a valuable contributor toward safely ensuring aircraft’s very
low impact form of access to the Park,” he added.</p>



<p>Article I of the document concludes: “The NPS benefits from the
efficient operation of these sites as a result of the maintenance of safer
airstrips for use by the Park and the public.”</p>



<p>The agreement names the RAF, and specifically RAF California Liaison Rick Lach, as sole contact with the Park. Lach has mustered volunteers over the years to assist with the re-opening of the gravel strip after seasonal washouts, and helped provide maintenance every autumn. “We have no problem rounding up twenty or so volunteers from all over California and Arizona for a work weekend,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rick has proven that we are folks who are willing to invest
sweat equity for the opportunity to use these three dispersed airstrips,” RAF
President Bill McGlynn said.</p>



<p>The NPS will provide a drag to smooth Chicken Strip, with the
RAF providing a pickup to pull it and a tractor with bucket or blade, if necessary
and all hand or power tools needed. Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells are
paved, so the RAF is only expected to help maintain runway markers and
tiedowns, and remove vegetation if requested by Park officials.</p>



<p>“I’d like to thank Mike Reynolds, Park Superintendent, for his support of this win-win outcome,” Lach added.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Creighton-visitor-1024x768.jpg">A happy young visitor to the December Creighton Island Fly-In.



<p>RAF Georgia Ambassador Eric Davis reports another successful weekend fly-in at Creighton Island December&nbsp;6-8.&nbsp;Attendees Eric and Sandy Peyrot flew their C182 in from Summerland, FL and said it was a “fantastic fly-in location,” adding, “getting to see the area by air and then get up close on an undeveloped island was a real treat.”<br>
<br>While there, Davis installed additional radios on the tower and at owner Frank WIlliams’s lodges to extend wifi service to structures on the west side of the island. “The tower wifi signal reaches the tie-down area east of the runway as long as you can see the tower,” Davis said. He reports that the SSID is&nbsp;<em>CREIGHTON</em>&nbsp;and the password is&nbsp;<em>landshort.</em>&nbsp;See the Airfield.Guide for further details. Davis reminds that access is only during announced fly-ins, unless you contact owner Frank Williams prior to flying in, and receive a field report. This is for safety concerns, as field conditions can change rapidly.<br>
<br>“The eventual plan is to build a solar/battery stand on the east side that will provide enough generation and storage capacity to power camp lighting and fans during summer nights,and device charging and wifi access,” Davis said, all improvements to benefit visitors who fly in. Davis has also engineered a system that monitors the solar charging and battery status at the tower. Battery voltage has remained steady at about 12.5 volts and the solar voltage rises and falls with the sun.&nbsp;<br>
<br>In the planning stage is an ADS-B tracker on aircraft that land or take off from Creighton Island. Mr. Williams will get an SMS text whenever someone arrives or departs. “The objective is to increase safety since the airfield is not continuously attended,” Davis said. “Also, we’ll have an electronic visitor log.”</p>

<p>Thanks to a $30,000 grant from the RAF, a new pilot shelter is near completion at Astronaut Kent Rominger Airport (KRCV) in Del Norte, Colorado.<br>
<br>RAF Colorado Liaison Tom Haefeli reports that other funding includes $5,500 in cash donations, $18,200 in donated labor, supplies, heavy equipment use and operation from the various contractors involved. Rio Grande County supplied the balance of funding from its Airport Fund. “It was truly a community project,” Haefeli said.&nbsp;<br>
<br>The Airport Advisory Board developed an idea for a multi-use facility that would be easy to maintain and could be of benefit to the local community as well.<br>
<br>The facility will offer WiFi, refrigerator, stove and restroom with shower. Next spring will see the addition of prepared campsites adjacent to the pilot shelter to accommodate people flying in to recreate in the area.<br>
<br>Haefeli has served with Pat Romano as an RAF Colorado Liaison for the past six years. In that time, the RAF invested in the area with a grant to the Rio Grande Headwaters Land Trust to assist in their successful effort to acquire a conservation easement for La Garita Creek Ranch. The RAF also provided a grant to the owners of the La Garita Creek Ranch for maintenance of the recreational use airstrip located there.<br>
<br>Haefeli invites pilots to come and enjoy the new facility while exploring the many recreational opportunities in the region. “I especially want to thank Lisa Yund for designing the eye-popping interior,” he added.&nbsp;Watch for the upcoming Grand Opening this summer!</p>

<p>As reported, the Selectboard meeting and public hearing about the possible closure of Maine’s Charles A. Chase Memorial airfield (44B) in Dover-Foxcroft took place November 12. The town manager and at least one select person wanted to close the airfield and construct a solar farm on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>“There was a very large turnout of local citizens and pilots, in spite of terrible weather, with no one in favor of closing the airport,” RAF Maine Liaison Steve Mason said.&nbsp;<br>
<br>The RAF was well represented, Mason reported. Joining him at the meeting were New Hampshire Liaison John Meade, Massachusetts Liaison Rene Robillard and Sean Collins from AOPA. “We all gave compelling testimony to keep the airport open and our remarks were well received,” he added. In the end, the select board voted unanimously to find alternative sites for the solar farm. The Town Manager will no longer serve as the airport manager – an interim was appointed – and an airport committee will be formed to help insure the airport’s future.<br>
<br>“We, as representatives of the RAF, were thanked beyond belief for our help and support,” Mason said. “We’ve offered our continued support as the Town of Dover- Foxcroft moves forward with a more formal plan for the future of the airfield,” he added.</p>

<p>Your action can make a difference!</p>



<p>Maine pilots learned that the town of Dover-Foxcroft is considering closing Charles A. Chase Jr. Memorial Airfield (44B) to install a four megawatt solar generating plant. RAF Maine Liaison Andy Rowe, Steve Mason and RAF New Hampshire Liaison John Meade are rallying pilots to protect the 2,926-ft scenic airfield. Camping is encouraged on the field, and it’s within a mile from town that lines the Piscataquis River.</p>



<p>A public meeting is scheduled at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, November
12 at the Morton Avenue Municipal Building in Dover-Foxcroft.</p>



<p>If you cannot attend the meeting, you are asked to send
emails of support to the Board of Selectmen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some relevant points:</p>



<p>• There are other suitable locations to site a solar plant,
that would not close this historic airfield.</p>



<p>• Closing the airfield disregards the honor of the Charles
A. Chase family, who dedicated the land for a public airport in the 1950s. The
family supports its continued operation.</p>



<p>• Acreage exists surrounding the runway. The city could
explore shared land use. Decommissioning the airfield is a permanent closure
that simply is unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Open land is available close to a substation, near
three-phase power.</p>



<p>• Solar arrays have been installed on landfill properties.
Dover-Foxcroft’s is approximately 30 acres and would be an ideal location for
solar panels.</p>



<p>• Recreational airfields have economic value to a community.</p>



<p>• There are pilot organizations such as the Recreational
Aviation Foundation with willing volunteers that assist with maintaining
airfields.</p>



<p>Please send your comments before Tuesday, November 12 to
members of the Board of Selectmen:</p>

<p>RAF Utah Liaison Wayne Loeber reports that the October 25-26
work party at Grand Gulch Mine airstrip in Arizona was productive. Four
aircraft brought enough people to clear campsites and the&nbsp;north half of
the runway.&nbsp;The airstrip is on land managed by the BLM, and on Saturday,
Erica Jensen, a BLM intern arrived to install an informational kiosk near the
windsock. When Erica finished her BLM task, she spent several hours working
with the volunteers on the runway.</p>



<p>Perry Null and his wife Sandra from New Mexico were spending
their anniversary weekend at Bar Ten Ranch, but flew in to help. “They whacked
weeds and threw rocks for three hours,” Loeber said, adding,&nbsp;“That’s
showing your bride a good time!”</p>



<p>Wendy Lessig flew down from Tooele, and Scott Reuben from Cedar City brought passengers in to help. We appreciate everyone’s dedication to maintaining another recreational airstrip. Grand Gulch does not have an identifier, but it’s located less than ten nm north of the Pearce Ferry Sector of the Grand Canyon Special Airspace.</p>

<p>Georgia
RAF Ambassador Eric Davis reports on a very successful work week October 7-13
at Creighton Island.</p>



<p>“I’d
been exploring the idea of island Internet service for several years now,”
Davis said. “Having personally flown to Creighton Island many times, I can
attest to the diversity of weather relative to the nearest reporting stations,”
he added. Thus, his desire to establish accurate localized weather.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There
is no commercial electricity available on the island, so his design included a
pair of 100W solar panels, charging controllers, and enough battery storage to
ensure continuous operation for at least a week without any solar charging.</p>



<p>During
the work week, Eric was helped by his father Gary, RAF Florida Ambassador Joe
Deleon, Chris Sullivan, Atlas Wegman, RAF Georgia Ambassador Brian Unrein, Lucy
and Teresa Unrein, Chris Stafford, Alan Sikes, Josh Coggin and his son, Robert
Brennan, and Neil O’Connor. They made major strides in bringing Internet
service out to the island, connecting to the solar battery plant, weather
station, and ADS-B receiver facility that they had previously built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Davis
envisions future expansion that will extend WiFi service to the lodging on the
island, and possibly installing runway webcams.</p>



<p>Creighton
Island weather data can be viewed on Weather Underground or using this
URL:&nbsp;<a href="https://smartweather.weatherflow.com/station/10998/grid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://smartweather.weatherflow.com/station/10998/grid</a>
</p>



<p>The
volunteers also cleared a significant number of palm and pine trees that were
encroaching upon the runway edges, creating a choke point in the middle third
of the runway. They painted some palm stumps to create a strong visual runway
sideline. “During future visits, we will continue to chip away at runway edges
to increase safety margins,” Davis said.</p>



<p>Watch for future accomplishments at Creighton Island, under the leadership of Davis and his crew.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Volunteers associated with the Recreational Aviation Foundation achieved substantial improvements to Alaska’s Bold Airstrip (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/A13">A13</a>), located at the southeast end of Eklutna Lake, near Anchorage on Saturday, August 31. The group was joined by a volunteer from the local EAA Chapter.<br>
<br> “With the cooperation and approval of Chugach State Park officials, a small but intrepid band of aviators used a brush mower, weed whackers, chainsaws and hand tools to clear the airstrip of encroaching aspen and other brush,” RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton said. He used his diesel powered GMC to tow a riding grader under the control of volunteer David Karalunas, to smooth and fill ruts in the airstrip’s gravel surface. Volunteers also removed brush from the camping area and towed and positioned a log to discourage access to the strip by wheeled vehicles.<br>
<br> The RAF thanks Chugach State Park Director Kurt Hensel and Ranger Keith Wilson for providing special permits to allow the equipment to move over the rugged access road to the strip on days normally closed to vehicles, and for providing the brush mower and grader in support of the work. Mr. Hensel emailed his appreciation for their efforts, writing, “Great job!! Thank you all for working out the details and seeing this project through.”<br>
<br> Clayton and the RAF thanks the hardworking team of David and Pam Karalunas, Tim and Michele McLain, David Baldwin and Sam Warner for all their hard work on the ground. “Local pilots are already expressing thanks for the job well done,” Clayton added. </p>

<p>
<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TimRileyIdaho-300x237.jpg">Tim is a native of upstate New York. His introduction to aviation was as a youngster in a Beaver on floats on the lakes in the Adirondacks. He has lived and traveled around the world during a career in the data networking and security industry.</p>
<p>Starting with hang gliders and paragliders, Tim has flown foot launched gliders thousands of miles across California, Nevada, and the Western US. “You never knew where the day was going to end, but it was guaranteed to be an adventure. You might even share a few thermals with a condor or hawk along the way,” he says.</p>
<p>As the kids grew, Tim switched to airplanes to share the joy of flying with his family, accumulating over 30 years of recreational flying experience. “From Baja to the Florida Everglades, from Mount Rushmore to Niagara Falls, recreational aviation is an incredible way to see the country,” he says. Tim’s additional aviation pursuits included owning a flight school and maintenance shop, providing flight instruction, and selling new and used aircraft.</p>
<p>Tim’s wife Janette is also a pilot and they are based in Driggs, Idaho, where he serves on the Driggs Reed Memorial Airport board. The couple enjoys spending time outdoors, hiking, kayaking, skiing and especially backcountry flying and camping.</p>
<p>“By far, over the years, the best thing about flying has been the incredible number of kind and generous people we’ve met,” Tim says, adding, “the RAF is the epitome of this flying and family spirit. It is a privilege to work with such a group on preserving access for everyone to enjoy.”</p>]]>

<p>After stints instructing in Asia and back in California, Julian stepped into the role of an airline pilot during what would become a turbulent time for the industry. After the events of September 11, 2001, he returned to flying smaller airplanes as an air ambulance pilot in eastern Oregon while spending off-days flying firefighters around the country in a Boeing 737.</p>



<p>Flying has been in Julian’s blood from a young age. He learned to fly at the airport on the campus at University of California, Davis while completing a degree in Environmental Planning and Management. Right after graduating, he started to fly for a living.</p>



<p>Julian has been at Southwest Airlines “for enough time to be able to bid the days off I need to fly my Maule around looking for new adventures,” he says. Now he is adding the role of RAF Nevada Liaison, and looks forward to the adventures that will bring.</p>]]>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Saline-Valley-May-2018-1024x672.jpg">



<p>After ten years of
communications and cooperation with the National Park Service (NPS), the RAF is
pleased to announce that Saline Valley’s “Chicken Strip” in Death Valley
National Park was officially authorized on August 19. The Federal Register
states that “the Chicken Strip has been in continuous use for decades,
pre-dating the management of the Area by the NPS. This rule will formalize its
continued operation as a backcountry airstrip.” The ruling takes effect
immediately.</p>



<p>“This is about what we
do to fulfill our mission,” RAF board chairman John McKenna said. “The major
credit for this accomplishment goes to everyone who got involved, wrote
letters, and remained engaged to save and preserve an airstrip.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s
official now,” said RAF California Liaison Rick Lach, who organizes the
seasonal volunteer work parties at the strip,&nbsp;and took the lead on communicating with the NPS. “The aviation community demonstrated its sincere desire
to maintain access at Chicken Strip with volunteer labor and input during the
public comment period.” Lach said his experience with Park personnel was
amicable, and highly professional throughout the lengthy process.</p>



<p>The NPS assumed the
land from the BLM in 1994. Having come under NPS management, the landing strip
was technically closed by default. Park staff were not aware that Chicken Strip
was not authorized, and did not enforce its closed status.</p>



<p>“The RAF and the NPS
have been successfully partnering through a Memorandum of Understanding to make
access to Chicken Strip safe and available to the aviation community,” McKenna
added. The MOU was renewed in 2017 that allows the RAF to maintain Chicken
Strip under NPS supervision at no cost to taxpayers.</p>



<p>“We believe this is a
common sense approach that corrects a regulatory technicality,” Death Valley
National Park Superintendent Mike Reynolds said.</p>



<p>The Federal Register
added, “Retaining use of the airstrip will benefit visitor use and experience
for those visitors who seek this type of recreation . . .”</p>



<p>The use of the airstrip is technically demanding and is therefore somewhat self-regulating, according to the NPS, and they do not anticipate that this ruling will lead to increased aircraft use at the Saline Valley Warm Springs Area.</p>

<p>Washington Liaison Dave Whitelaw and his brother John&nbsp;report
that the&nbsp;annual&nbsp;Sullivan&nbsp;Lake (09S)&nbsp;fly-in&nbsp;near
Metaline Falls&nbsp;in northeast Washington State&nbsp;(August 2-4)&nbsp;was&nbsp;a
success.&nbsp;“We had beautiful weather after being hampered by fires and thick
smoke the last three years,” Dave said.</p>



<p>Twenty-two aircraft flew in, including two by water that
beached on the nice gravel. Around 30 folks&nbsp;enjoyed the weekend, some
donning official orange vests in order to repair fence and fill gopher holes
under the supervision of Washington State Transportation Airport Manager Paul
Wolf.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several hiked the trails along the lake, cooling off with a
refreshing swim afterward. Saturday evening’s potluck came together around the
Whitelaw’s New York Italian sausage with sautéed onions and peppers, along with
barbecued salmon. Others contributed their favorite side dishes and desserts.</p>



<p>Around the evening campfire, RAF member Don Goodman shared
his and his wife Natala’s experience landing at the municipal or county airport
in each of Washington State’s 39 counties in one day. The flight required a lot
of planning, resulting in a long 14-hour day with 10 hours of stick time.&nbsp;The
reward was a sunrise departure, beautiful varied scenery, and some new friends
along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We all are looking forward to next year’s&nbsp;Sullivan&nbsp;Lake Fly-in,” Dave said.</p>

<p>Dan Prill, a founding member of the Recreational Aviation Foundation, spent ten years on its Board of Directors; eight years as Vice President. Dan was instrumental from its initial formation to helping the organization attain 5,000 members by the end of his term in 2013. “It has been a rewarding journey,” Dan says, adding, “I am very proud of the RAF army of volunteers who work so hard to advance the RAF mission. Our 25 State Liaisons and each of our many volunteers wear their volunteerism as a badge of honor.”</p>



<p>The organization began in Montana, because the Founders knew the issues and had already made many land manager contacts. “While working in Montana, we formed our mission and learned the right way to do things,” Dan says. The RAF then used those principles to advance its mission throughout the country. “The RAF has always taken the ‘high road’ when dealing with policy makers. Our data is factual and science based. We also approach issues in kind and courteous manner.”</p>



<p>The RAF is especially proud of Dan’s work getting the Russian Flat Airstrip approved and built in Montana’s Lewis and Clark National Forest – the first new airstrip on U.S. Forest Service land in over forty years. Dan worked throughout seven years of meetings and two more years of construction with all volunteer labor, so today many people can use the airstrip for camping and recreation. Dan was awarded the RAF’s Golden Pulaski for his work on Russian Flat at an annual fly-in there.</p>



<p>A key to advancing the RAF mission is educating land managers, policy makers and Senators and Congressmen. Dan has been to Washington, D.C. many times during his tenure. The U.S. Forest Service adopted its new planning rule during a six-week series of meetings, and Dan attended all of those meetings. His time and expense paid off, as today the Planning Rule acknowledges the importance of recreational aviation. RAF volunteers carry on Dan’s commitment to the process, and attend the public meetings.</p>



<p>The RAF website is critical to its mission. When it had to be upgraded, Dan volunteered to be the “project manager” and worked with John Kounis of Pilot Getaways magazine. The improved website now incorporates a membership database and is invaluable to the operation.</p>



<p>Aviation trade shows have played a large role in RAF’s growth, and Dan and his wife Margie have attended nearly all of them. Margie always pitched right in to help with the work and the hospitality.</p>



<p>Dan has traveled all over the country during his tenure on the board. He treasures the friendships he and Margie have made. “Even though I won’t be a director, I will still work hard for the RAF in any way I can,” Dan says, and urges others to support the organization by volunteering or donating, “and enjoy the resources of recreational and backcountry airstrips. The airstrips are why we do this, so go enjoy them.”</p>

<p>Rol has a wide ranging background, having worked in aerospace acoustics, film and video production, theatre operations, and management. Along the way his enthusiasm for aviation led from avocation to advocacy of local airports to vocation, including work for AOPA and the Wolf Aviation Fund. He now lives on the Continental Divide in northern New Mexico.</p>



<p>As a long time backpacker and camper, one of Rol’s motivations for learning to fly in 1975 was for accessing by air some of his favorite places in the High Sierras and the desert areas of the Southwest, and to travel from his home in L.A. to visit friends in New Mexico. A setback making a lasting impression on Rol was the closure of one of his favorite airstrips in the Sierras-Templeton Meadows – with no opportunity for review.</p>



<p>Rol became familiar with the Recreational Aviation Foundation while serving on the committee to establish the Idaho Airstrip Network. He joined the RAF as a Director working on national issues and also worked to create a New Mexico airstrips committee which has become extremely active promoting backcountry flying in that state. Rol’s work now sees him advising airstrip advocates and RAF State Liaisons in the adjoining states as well.</p>

<![CDATA[<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Director Emeritus</h2>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chuck-Jarecki.jpg">



<p>Starting out in a Piper Super Cub, Chuck got his private rating in 1960. Seeking further flying knowledge, he gained his commercial and glider licenses in 1961; then seaplane and instrument ratings. He bought a brand-new Cessna 180 in 1976 and began exploring North America from the air. He and his wife Penny have a map of the Continent, criss-crossed with their flights.</p>



<p>Chuck can count the number of controlled airports he’s used, preferring more remote areas. From Nome, Alaska, to Panama; and to the northern tip of Labrador in eastern Canada he’s accumulated over 5,000 hours. His passion is for the backcountry and the recreational experience it offers. He still enjoys his 180 on wheels but added a 1975 Cessna 185 on amphibious floats several years ago.</p>



<p>Chuck brings a wealth of knowledge on natural resource management to the RAF. His career spanned thirty years as owner/operator of a 7,000 acre cattle ranch in northwestern Montana. He’s received awards for excellence in grazing land management and soil stewardship. He served on a National Academy of Sciences committee, writing a book on evaluating rangeland health. Chuck is the go-to guy on weed control, having served ten years on Montana’s noxious weed advisory committee.</p>



<p>His professional associations include Society for Range Management, Montana Stockgrowers Association, past president of the Western Montana Stockmen’s Association, and Montana Beef Council-all of which offer vast background in public lands issues and environmental concerns.</p>



<p>Besides being a founding director of the RAF, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.montanapilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montana Pilots Association (MPA)</a>&nbsp;tapped into Chuck’s experience, seating him on its board of directors.</p>



<p>Chuck’s involvement with the RAF has been extensive. In addition to sweat-equity projects like the campground, shelter, and airstrip improvements at Ryan Field near Glacier Park, Chuck compiled the RAF’s “Recreational Airstrips, Issues, and Opportunities.” He drafted language for the recently-passed US House Resolution supporting recreational aviation and airstrips; and led the cooperative effort between the RAF and MPA to preserve six airstrips within the Upper Missouri Breaks National Monument.</p>



<p>What motivates Chuck to work tirelessly for the RAF? “I didn’t want the next generation of pilots to say, ‘Why didn’t someone do something to preserve those airstrips when they had the chance? Now it’s too late.'”</p>

<p>
<strong>Thoughts After Retirement</strong>
</p>



<p>When I raised my hand at the Montana Pilots Association’s (MPA) Board of Directors retreat in Bozeman in September of 2003, I had no idea what I was getting myself into!&nbsp; I had been following the MPA’s Recreational Airstrip Committee for several years and watching them try to raise money. I even donated dogsled rides for their online auction.&nbsp; To boost their fundraising effectiveness I suggested&nbsp; they create an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 501(c) (3) Public Charity in order to solicit tax-deductible donations.</p>



<p>Since the MPA charter included commercial aviation a legally separate organization needed to be created, and about a half dozen attendees indicated that they would like to be involved in such an organization and I set it up.</p>



<p>We decided on the name Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF).&nbsp; We decided that it should be a national organization – not limited to just Montana – since we were now going to be separate from the MPA.&nbsp; After further discussion about mission, organization, location, etc., I began the process of filing the application with the State of Montana to become a Montana Non-Profit organization and then with the IRS to become a 501(c) (3) Public Charity.</p>



<p>During the process, I needed and asked for Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, Mission Statement, logo, etc..&nbsp; To my surprise, when I sent out an email asking for these, the reply was almost immediate.&nbsp; I then found out that several of the pilots at the organizing meeting in Bozeman had previously been involved in trying to create just such an organization several years before to be named the Backcountry Airstrip Foundation or BAF.&nbsp; They had already created the necessary documentation, etc., but hadn’t actually filed with a state and the IRS.&nbsp; It was agreed to change BAF to RAF and other necessary modifications were made, and I filed everything with the State of Montana and the IRS in December 2003.</p>



<p>After about 90 days, the IRS requested more documentation. I sent the IRS a one-inch three-ring binder filled with all of the information they requested. 90 days later, we received our Letter of Determination granting the RAF 501(c) (3) Public Charity status effective in December 2003.</p>



<p>From there the rest is history.&nbsp;We started with our original Board Of Directors made up mostly from the pilots at the original organizing meeting in Bozeman plus a few new ones to satisfy IRS requirements.&nbsp;I volunteered to be Secretary / Treasurer.&nbsp;By the end of 2004, we had about $15,000 in the bank and a membership of several hundred. I continued in this role for eight years retiring December 31, 2011, when the RAF membership had grown to several thousand from all fifty states and about a dozen foreign countries. The RAF had preserved, maintained, and created multiple backcountry airstrips across the country, and my RAF activities had become so involved that I was spending ten to fourteen hours almost every day trying to keep up with it. I was either going to retire or go insane!</p>



<p>Fortunately, the transition of my duties to a new Administrative Director and new Treasurer went fairly smoothly, and I was able to retire as “Director Emeritus” which meant that I could continue to participate in BOD activities without the right to vote. I have continued to monitor and participate as appropriate in emails and the monthly BOD teleconferences, and other activities.&nbsp;It’s extremely satisfying to observe how the RAF is progressing and growing on a first-hand basis.&nbsp;Wow! Retirement is wonderful!</p>



<p>I could not have imagined in 2003 what the RAF would accomplish in its first ten years and could not be more proud of those accomplishments and the members of the BOD, and the membership who make this all possible through their generous support of both their time and their dollars.&nbsp; And to do all of this with all volunteers except for the Administrative Director is absolutely phenomenal!&nbsp; Again, who would have imagined what has been accomplished.&nbsp; The RAF is now nationally recognized as the “go to” organization for anything related to recreational and backcountry airstrips.</p>



<p>I offer a big “Thank you!” and “Well done!” to all who have been a part of the RAF.&nbsp; Keep up the good work, and good luck.&nbsp; I hope I will be around and involved for the next ten years!</p>

<p>Alan’s business acumen and impressive experience on professional boards qualified him for a&nbsp;RAF board position.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he demonstrated his sleeves-rolled-up dedication to its mission when he flew from his home in Pennsylvania to Ryan Field for a work party.</p>



<p>Raised in Pennsylvania, Alan began flying for his diversified forest products business in 1994. His Cessna 185 provided the opportunity to share his passion with his family – wife Jill and their three sons, now in their 20s. Alan also owns a Scout. The planes are utilized for business or to reach his favorite recreational places, including their cabin in the Missouri Breaks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“When the RAF fought successfully to preserve the six strips in the Missouri Breaks Monument, that really got my attention,” Alan said.</p>



<p>Alan chairs Pennsylvania’s Forest Products Assoc., serves on the Kish Bank board and the Mifflin County Airport (KRVL ) Authority board. His forest products management has given him the opportunity to work with land managers from various state agencies. Alan appreciates the work the RAF has done to create positive relationships, saying, “The RAF has a successful working relationship with decision-makers in DC, the states, the BLM and Forest Service. I was impressed with the method that the RAF uses to accomplish their mission.”</p>



<p>RAF President John McKenna adds, “When I met Alan, I knew right away that he loves to share his passion for flying into the backcountry, and is willing to work hard to preserve the privilege.”</p>



<p>“The RAF has brought the pilot community together to work on common goals,” Alan said</p>

<![CDATA[<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Director Emeritus</h2>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steve-Johnson.jpg">



<p>Steve “SJ” Johnson came to aviation from an unusual direction. Fear of flying on commercial airliners led him to confront the fear and start taking flying lessons in 1997. A rocky start – including an accident as a low-time pilot – fueled his determination to learn all he could about flying. Now a 4500+ hour pilot, Gold Seal flight instructor, dedicated advocate of aviation and aviation safety, those days seem very long ago.</p>



<p>In 2000, Steve bought his first Super Cub. He started SuperCub.Org, a website for Super Cub and backcountry aviation enthusiasts which continues to grow. Website members focused Steve’s passion for aviation into a vehicle to enhance access to some of the most beautiful parts of our country. Steve strongly believes that through proper introduction and education, we can help others understand why backcountry aviation is a viable, valuable, and safe combination – and a whole lot of fun.</p>

<p>Wild Billy Lake is located on 1,100 acres of private land in south-central Oregon. The property sits on a mesa above the Sycan and Sprague river valleys at 4,500-ft elevation. With no signs of civilization, you have a feeling that you are completely alone with nature.  </p>



<p>The lake is over 200 acres in size and is managed as a destination retreat for fly fishermen in search of trophy rainbow trout. Wild Billy Lake is so much more than just a world-class fishery; it is a place to experience the High Desert ecosystem in a private, intimate setting. </p>



<p>In 2018 one of the property owners, RAF member Mike Mooney, approached RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes to discuss the practicality of creating an airstrip at Wild Billy Lake. Both agreed that an airstrip would be a great asset for both the property owners and the backcountry pilot community. Plans were made and the necessary permits obtained. A local contractor completed the project in late June, 2019.</p>



<p>The landowners invited Oregon RAF members to fly in on July 12 and 13. Pilots and friends arrived in 10 aircraft. Several visitors spent the night Friday in guest cabins, and were treated to lunch, dinner and Saturday breakfast by the owners.</p>



<p>Fishing was a bit slow due to warm temperatures, but a few nice trout were landed. Everyone was impressed with the recreation opportunities of Wild Billy Lake. In addition to trophy fishing, the facility provides opportunities for paddle sports, mountain biking, and wildlife viewing.</p>



<p>Alternatively, grab a cup of coffee and your favorite book and settle into fireside tranquility next to your cabin’s wood stove or the lakeside fire pit. <br> For more information about Wild Billy Lake, including a required safety briefing, go to: <a href="http://wildbillylake.com">http://wildbillylake.com</a>.

<p>“I want to thank airport manager Jeff Kadlec for his help at the work party as well as coordinating the work to be done,” Scott said.</p>
<p>Among the volunteers were RAF Montana Liaison Ron Normandeau, Texas and Montana Ambassador Steve Maus, Administrative Director Tricia McKenna, Vice President Jack Tyler, and Volunteer Coordinator Erin White and her son August.</p>

<p>The RAF is primarily volunteer-driven, meaning your donations go directly toward on-the-ground projects that further the RAF mission to preserve, maintain, and create airstrips for recreational access.</p>
<p>Volunteer RAF state liaisons identify projects, then apply for RAF funds. A grants committee – made up of State Liaisons, RAF members and an RAF Director – then reviews the application. Typically, the liaison must also organize volunteers to help with the labor required. Often, they call in others who are willing to donate or provide equipment and building supplies at no cost, or at reduced prices.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of recent grants awarded:</p>
<p>
<strong>Wisconsin:</strong> RAF Liaison <a href="mailto:jrussell@theraf.org">Jeff Russell</a> will oversee improvements at Cornucopia Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/WI23">WI23</a>). The project includes construction of a pilot shelter, adding picnic tables, tie downs and bicycles. Jeff worked with the airport manager and local businesses to foster support for investing time and money to make the airport more inviting. “This airstrip has high recreational value due to its proximity to Lake Superior and the Apostle Island National Lakeshore,” Jeff said.</p>
<p>
<strong>Minnesota:</strong> RAF Liaison <a href="mailto:kpennuto@theraf.org">Kurt Pennuto</a>  was awarded a grant to improve Bowstring Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/9Y0">9Y0</a>). He will complete two campsites, picnic tables, fire rings and an outhouse. From each campsite, campers will be able to access the Chippewa National Forest, area lakes, trails and hunting opportunities. The airport commission has committed to maintaining the campsites and outhouse.</p>
<p>
<strong>New Hampshire:</strong> Liaison <a href="mailto:jmeade@theraf.org">John Meade</a>  has taken Parlin Airfield (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/2B3">2B3</a>) under his wing for preservation and improvements, adding picnic tables, and solar chargers. Its amenities include camping and access to local Sugar Hill Recreation Trails with use of mountain bicycles at no cost. John emphasizes that local personnel do much of the work “which increases broad community commitment and teamwork, while insuring lower operating costs for the town.  Parlin has become a regional fly-in destination,” he added.</p>
<p>
<strong>Colorado:</strong> Liaison <a href="mailto:thaefeli@theraf.org">Tom Haefeli </a> says the cornerstone of his pilot shelter project at Ken Rominger airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KRCV">KRCV</a>) will be the new shower and kitchen area. “This will allow airplane campers, mountain bikers, and pilots a place to refuel, refresh and continue great airplane adventures,” he said. The airport is three miles north of Del Norte, central to many Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico airstrips. “This shelter will also be a great resource for cross country travelers as well,” he added. Rio Grande County is a key partner for the project.</p>
<p>
<strong>Vermont:</strong> <a href="mailto:bburley@theraf.org">Bob Burley</a> is fond of Allenholm Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/VT26">VT26</a>), and wants to preserve it from possible closure and improve it with funding for mowing and added improvements. Maybe the regionally famous Allenholm Farms pies, pastries, cookies available at the airfield is one reason! This historic 2,400-ft field is located in an apple orchard on an island in Lake Champlain. Within one mile of the airfield is a state park with beaches and watercraft rentals, several B&amp;Bs, and a quaint Vermont village.  All within a half- or hour-long flight are scenic mountains and islands, a four- star, 150-year-old lakeside resort, golf course and grass strip. “Allenholm is ideal for both hub and spoke day trips and peaceful respite,” Bob said. Vermont Air National Guard pilots are committed to helping out at Parlin.</p>
<p>
<strong>Florida:</strong> What started out in 2013 as efforts to reopen abandoned Blackwater Airfield (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/8FD3">8FD3</a>), has developed into ongoing cooperation to improve this popular recreational destination. RAF Florida Liaison <a href="mailto:bcapozzi@theraf.org">Bobby Capozzi</a> continues to work with Florida Sport Aviation Antique and Classic Association (FSAACA) by adding barbecue grills, and refinishing picnic tables. “These efforts show continued engagement and commitment to foster a positive relationship with the State Forestry Service in preserving and maintaining this recreational airfield,” Bobby said.  “Not only was the project approved by State Forestry Manager David Creamer, he was willing to assist with installing the grills,” Bobby added.</p>
<p>Bobby also erected a sign acknowledging participants. “The sign is an investment in advertising for all who worked so hard to get Blackwater open to GA,” Bobby said.</p>
<p>
<strong>Oregon:</strong> RAF Oregon Liaison <a href="mailto:rmayes@theraf.org">Richard Mayes</a> has a less tangible need. He was invited to join the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative (HCRC) whose mission is to maintain and improve recreation access into the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area by making recommendations to the US Forest Service. “RAF representation on the HCRC will help protect and maintain public access to the Hells Canyon airstrips, and foster positive collaboration with other river users,” Richard said.</p>
<p>The area encompasses 652,488 acres of rugged backcountry between northeastern Oregon and western Idaho.  There are no roads across Hells Canyon’s 10-mile wide expanse. Six backcountry airstrips deep in the canyon along the Snake River are open for public use.  Administration of HCRC is funded by contributions from key participant organizations. Richard works entirely at his own expense, but the largest HCRC administrative cost is the salary of the part-time facilitator. Idaho Aviation Association pledged support, and Richard requested a like amount.</p>

<p>Jake has spent his whole life in photography. Having grown up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, Jake found a love of the outdoor world at a young age. In 2006 Jake came up to Bozeman, MT to attend classes at MSU, but like so many other people after four years he decided to stay in Bozeman.</p>



<p>It was in 2009 at the Pylon Race Seminar in Reno, NV that he found his love for aviation. After many years and many airshows and fly-ins, his love for aviation has remained.</p>



<p>Now in his early thirties, he has already earned his place in the photography realm, having numerous articles and photographs published in a variety of publications. Jake continues to strive towards capturing more romantic and interesting photographs while further advancing his own knowledge along with those that follow his work.</p>]]>

<p>RAF State Liaisons, Ambassadors and other key RAF volunteers were available for the Q&amp;A discussion following each program, and shared the RAF mission with audiences.

<p>In Oregon recently, the RAF worked in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Aviation (ODA) to maintain McKenzie Bridge State Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/00S">00S</a>), a premier backcountry airfield located in the Cascade Range.</p>
<p>“We had an excellent turnout, everyone contributed and had a good time,” RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes said of the June 1 work party. Approximately 30 volunteers attended, most camping on the airfield. Two RAF members who came from Northern California joined the Oregon group. Jason Brand and son Walter flew in their Citabria and had a chance to fish the beautiful McKenzie River.</p>
<p>Volunteers provided three tractors, industrial brush clearing equipment and a large assortment of hand tools. Taylor NW Construction of Bend provided 21 tons of graded fill materials to mitigate the damage caused by rodents and elk. Alex Hodge Construction, also of Bend, delivered the material. Grading Unlimited Inc. of Hillsboro and Cascade Civil Corp. of Redmond, provided additional heavy equipment for placement and compaction. ODA provided 18 horse stall mats that the workers painted white and installed at quarter points of the published runway length.</p>
<p>The crew mowed the airfield, tie-down, and helicopter operations areas; removed brush and small trees encroaching along the south side of the runway, and the overrun area at the west end of the runway; and repaired and remounted the damaged airport sign.</p>
<p>“We have made great improvements to the airfield over the past couple of years,” Richard said. The airfield surface is still rough, and pilots can find more information and the safety briefing on the <a href="https://airfield.guide.theraf.org/map/airfield-details/fbe82ea4-7900-4b4d-8e6f-7651cc30b541/overview?searchQuery=mcke">Airfield Guide</a>.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s support was greatly appreciated. The volunteers all worked very hard, but we also enjoyed the companionship of our fellow pilots who believe we have a responsibility to help preserve airfields such as McKenzie Bridge.” Richard said.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>RAF Minnesota Liaison Kurt Pennuto reports that the May 31-June 2 Bowstring work party weekend was “a huge success.” Volunteers completed two campsites, one with four tent pads and one with five tent pads. Each site now has an RAF fire ring, a picnic table and is just a short walk to a newly constructed outhouse. They installed a mailbox to hold a sign-in book and RAF information, and capped the work by installing signs at each campsite, “The RAF Supports This Airstrip”. All of the projects were funded by an RAF grant. For details on Bowstring (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/9Y0">9Y0</a>) see the <a href="https://airfield.guide/filter_airports.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airfield.Gui</a>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bowstring1.png">RAF work party volunteers completed two campsites at Bowstring Airport with tent pads, <br>fire rings, picnic tables and RAF signage.


<p>“The support from the Bowstring airport commission is a great partnership,” Kurt said, pointing out that five airport board members pitched in to help: Ken Reichert, Greg Miller, Mark Mathisen, Robert Johnson, and Robert Styve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Minnesota RAF Ambassador Rick Mercil attended, along with other volunteers&nbsp;Scott&nbsp;Moon, Frank Vittorio, Paul Schillo, and John Welna.</p>



<p>“On Sunday four more planes flew in to visit and check out the progress of the work party and marvel at our work,” Kurt said. One was Jason Jenson, a Department of Natural Resources pilot out tracking wolves, and one was RAF member Peter Howell who submitted an article about Bowstring to his RV pilot group.</p>



<p>“Jason Jenson has a keen interest in our mission, and his knowledge and connections within the DNR are valuable to us,” Kurt said. “Jason has given both Rick and me useful insight to the decision making process at the state level. We look for continued partnering with Jason and the state Department of Natural Resources,” he added.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RAF is primarily volunteer-driven, meaning your donations go directly toward on-the-ground projects that further the RAF mission to preserve, maintain, and create airstrips for recreational access.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Grants1-1024x768.jpg">



<p>Volunteer RAF state liaisons identify projects, then apply for RAF funds. A grants committee –&nbsp;made up of State Liaisons, RAF members and an RAF Director – then reviews the application. Typically, the liaison must also organize volunteers to help with the labor required. Often, they call in others who are willing to donate or provide equipment and building supplies at no cost, or at reduced prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a summary of recent grants awarded:</p>



<p>
<strong>Wisconsin</strong>: RAF Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jrussell@theraf.org">Jeff Russell</a>&nbsp;will oversee improvements at Cornucopia Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/WI23">WI23</a>). The project includes construction of a pilot shelter, adding picnic tables, tie downs and bicycles. Jeff worked with the airport manager and local businesses to foster support for investing time and money to make the airport more inviting.&nbsp;“This airstrip has high recreational value due to its proximity to Lake Superior and the Apostle Island National Lakeshore,” Jeff said.</p>



<p>
<strong>Minnesota</strong>: RAF Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kpennuto@theraf.org">Kurt Pennuto</a>&nbsp; was awarded a grant to improve Bowstring Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/9Y0">9Y0</a>). He will complete two campsites, picnic tables, fire rings and an outhouse.&nbsp;From each campsite, campers will be able to access the Chippewa National Forest, area lakes, trails and hunting opportunities. The airport commission has committed to maintaining the campsites and outhouse.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Grants2-1024x768.jpg">



<p>
<strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jmeade@theraf.org">John Meade</a>&nbsp; has taken Parlin Airfield (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/2B3">2B3</a>) under his wing for preservation and improvements, adding picnic tables, and solar chargers.&nbsp;Its amenities include camping and access to local Sugar Hill Recreation Trails with use of mountain bicycles at no cost.&nbsp;John emphasizes that local personnel do much of the work “which increases broad community commitment and teamwork, while insuring lower operating costs for the town.&nbsp; Parlin has become a regional fly-in destination,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Colorado</strong>: Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:thaefeli@theraf.org">Tom Haefeli&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;says the cornerstone of his pilot shelter project at Ken Rominger airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KRCV">KRCV</a>) will be the new shower and kitchen area.&nbsp;“This will allow airplane campers, mountain bikers, and pilots a place to refuel, refresh and continue great airplane adventures,” he said.&nbsp;The airport is three miles north of Del Norte, central to many Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico airstrips.&nbsp;“This shelter will also be a great resource for cross country travelers as well,” he added. Rio Grande County is a key partner for the project.</p>

<p> <strong>Vermont</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:bburley@theraf.org">Bob Burley</a>&nbsp;is fond of Allenholm Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/VT26">VT26</a>), and wants to preserve it from possible closure and improve it with funding for mowing and added improvements.&nbsp;Maybe the regionally famous Allenholm Farms pies, pastries, cookies available at the airfield is one reason!&nbsp;This historic 2,400-ft field is located in an apple orchard on an island in Lake Champlain.&nbsp;Within one mile of the airfield is a state park with beaches and watercraft rentals, several B&amp;Bs, and a quaint Vermont village.&nbsp; All within a half- or hour-long flight are scenic mountains and islands, a four- star, 150-year-old lakeside resort, golf course and grass strip.&nbsp;“Allenholm is ideal for both hub and spoke day trips and peaceful respite,” Bob said. Vermont Air National Guard pilots are committed to helping out at Parlin. </p>

<strong>Florida</strong>: What started out in 2013 as efforts to reopen abandoned Blackwater Airfield (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/8FD3">8FD3</a>), has developed into ongoing cooperation to improve this popular recreational destination.&nbsp;RAF Florida Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:bcapozzi@theraf.org">Bobby Capozzi</a>&nbsp;continues to work with Florida Sport Aviation Antique and Classic Association (FSAACA) by adding barbecue grills, and refinishing picnic tables. “These efforts show continued engagement and commitment to foster a positive relationship with the State Forestry Service in preserving and maintaining this recreational airfield,” Bobby said.&nbsp; “Not only was the project approved by State Forestry Manager David Creamer, he was willing to assist with installing the grills,” Bobby added.</p>



<p>Bobby also erected a sign acknowledging participants.&nbsp;“The sign is an investment in advertising for all who worked so hard to get Blackwater open to GA,” Bobby said.</p>



<p>
<strong>Oregon</strong>: RAF Oregon Liaison&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rmayes@theraf.org">Richard Mayes</a>&nbsp;has a less tangible need. He was invited to join the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative (HCRC) whose mission is to maintain and improve recreation access into the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area by making recommendations to the US Forest Service. “RAF representation on the HCRC will help protect and maintain public access to the Hells Canyon airstrips, and foster positive collaboration with other river users,” Richard said.</p>



<p>The area encompasses 652,488 acres of rugged backcountry between northeastern Oregon and western Idaho.&nbsp; There are no roads across Hells Canyon’s 10-mile wide expanse. Six backcountry airstrips deep in the canyon along the Snake River are open for public use.&nbsp; Administration of HCRC is funded by contributions from key participant organizations.&nbsp;Richard works entirely at his own expense, but the largest HCRC administrative cost is the salary of the part-time facilitator.&nbsp;Idaho Aviation Association pledged support, and Richard requested a like amount.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Your help is needed! Custer-Gallatin National Forest has released its Draft plan. The public comment period ends Thursday, June 6, 2019.</p>
<p>This Forest encompasses more than three million acres in SW Montana and South Dakota. There are six mountain ranges within the Forest complex.</p>
<p>Montana Liaison Ron Normandeau says this Draft “portrays a prejudice against airstrips and aircraft access.” We need to provide positive input advocating airstrips before the comment deadline on June 6.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Custer-Gallatin-Forest-300x232.jpg">
</p>
<p>Ron has excerpted the following relevant language regarding Airfields. Please refer to it before commenting:</p>
<p>2.4.12 Airfields, Aircraft Landing Strips (AIRFIELDS)</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Custer Gallatin National Forest does not manage any public or administrative airfields as part of the transportation system. The forest owns taxiways and tarmacs at the West Yellowstone Airport in support of the smokejumper and air tanker base. No public sites have been designated or authorized on the Custer Gallatin National Forest.</p>
<p>Desired conditions under general recreation apply to public recreational motorized aircraft landing strips.</p>
<p>Standards (FW-STD-AIRFIELDS)</p>
<p>01 Public recreational motorized aircraft landing and take-off shall only be allowed at designated and authorized sites.</p>
<p>02 Any new landing and take-off locations shall be constructed, maintained, and operated by the holder of a special use authorization.</p>
<p>Suitability (FW-SUIT-AIRFIELDS)</p>
<p>01 Backcountry aircraft landing strips are not suitable in designated wilderness, the Hyalite Porcupine Buffalo Horn Wilderness Study Area, the Cabin Creek Recreation Wildlife Management Area, National Natural Landmarks, the Wild Horse Territory, research natural areas, special areas, recommended wilderness areas, within ¼ mile each side of eligible wild rivers, within ½ mile each side of the Continental Divide Trail, riparian management zones, areas of primitive or semi-primitive nonmotorized recreation opportunity spectrum, or within the grizzly bear recovery zone. Backcountry aircraft landing strips are suitable in areas of rural, roaded natural and semi-primitive motorized recreation opportunity spectrum, outside of the designated areas listed in the preceding sentence.</p>
<p>Alternative D: Backcountry aircraft landing strips are not suitable anywhere on the Custer Gallatin National Forest.</p>
<p>Talking points to use in your comments.</p>
<p>1. Airstrip section portrays a forest prejudice against aircraft access.</p>
<p>2. Airfields Desired conditions under general recreation does not provide adequate guidance to future planners for the establishment of forest access by aircraft.</p>
<p>3. Desired conditions do not meet Planning Directives standards for presentation of the plan component; Desired Condition.</p>
<p>Excerpt from Plan Directive:</p>
<p>Desired conditions must be described in terms that are specific enough to allow progress toward their achievement to be determined, but do not include completion dates. (36 CFR 219.7(e)(1)(i)) Forest Service Handbook FS1909.12, Chapter 20, Sec 22.11 page 22</p>
<p>4. The airfields section does not address the five plan components: Desired Condition, Objectives, Standards, guidelines, and suitability. The directives require all five components to define an activity.</p>
<p>5. Excerpt from Plan Directive:</p>
<p>Plans must include the following plan components (36 CFR 219.7): desired conditions (sec. 22.11), objectives (sec. 22.12), standards (sec. 22.13), guidelines (sec. 22.14), and suitability of lands (sec. 22.15). Goals may be included as an optional plan component (sec. 22.16). Forest Service Handbook FS1909.12, Chapter 20, Sec 22.1 page 20</p>
<p>6. Under Suitability the list of areas “unsuitable for aircraft landing strips” is unsupported by law accept for designated wilderness and research natural areas.</p>
<p>7. Draft Environmental Impact Statement does not present any data on aircraft operations impact on the environment.</p>
<p>It’s easy to comment —Here’s how:</p>
<p>• Online at: https://tinyurl.com/caracgnf</p>
<p>• Email to cgplanrevision@fs.fed.us. Use Subject line “Comment – draft plan – CGNF”</p>
<p>By Mail to Custer Gallatin National Forest, Attn: Forest Plan Revision Team, P.O. Box 130, (10 E Babcock), Bozeman, MT 59771<br>The RAF has participated respectfully in previous Forest Plans with success. Please take a moment to comment. Your voice matters!</p>

<![CDATA[<p> “This year’s annual Winter’s Finally Over (WFO) hangar party saw the biggest attendance we have ever had with well over two hundred people,” RAF Wisconsin Liaison Jeff Russell reports.&nbsp;The gathering happened on Saturday,&nbsp;<strong>May 18&nbsp;</strong>at Morey Airport in Middleton, WI, and “was very successful and generated a lot of interest in the RAF, and $3,500 in donations for the RAF to use for the Cornucopia Airport,” Jeff added. There was live music, a table overflowing with potluck dishes, a prize table full of RAF logo wear, and many appealing donations from locals including a Husky flight experience, a box of cut and wrapped beef and pork, pet supplies, and Jeff’s gently-used Garmin Aera GPS. </p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WFO1.jpg">



<p> It’s obvious the Village of Cornucopia appreciates and loves its 2,000-ft turf airstrip, (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/WI23">WI23</a>) located on the Wisconsin shore of Lake Superior, 46 nm east of Duluth. The community held a Cornucopia Airport fundraiser the same evening at Justine Broderson’s colorful coffee shop with around 40 people attending.&nbsp;“As the population of the entire village is only ninety-eight people, this was a fantastic turnout,” Jeff said. Guests sipped wines and enjoyed an array of hors d’oeuvres while bidding on the many silent auction items and selecting donation amounts from the “Giving Tree” yielding another $1,240 in donations. </p>



<p>“Cornucopia Airport is located in a very beautiful part of Wisconsin with many recreational opportunities near the shoreline of Lake Superior,” Jeff said. Jeff has obtained an RAF grant to build a pilot shelter with steel siding, install four tie-downs, and provide three picnic tables and loaner bicycles for the one-mile trip into town. Funds raised at the WFO party and Village of Cornucopia fundraiser event will supplement the RAF grant, allowing for all proposed projects to be completed.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WFO6-1024x339.jpg">



<p>The RAF wishes to thank Justine and Tim Kaseno for spearheading the community event. “They did a fantastic job, and we are already making plans for next year and Phase II of airport improvements,” Jeff said.</p>

<![CDATA[<h2>Administrative Director</h2>
<p>

</p>


<p>Spending her childhood outdoors with family in the mountains surrounding Butte, Montana, Tricia learned all there was to know about setting up a tent, cooking over a campfire and enjoying sharing stories around the fire under the night sky. Aviation was not something she spent much time thinking about. Along came boyfriend John, who became husband John, who introduced her to small airplanes. It was not love at first sight when it came to aviation and it took some time to overcome Tricia’s fear of flying. To get over that hesitation, Tricia took instruction in the family Cessna 185. Her fear subsided quickly and learning all there was to know kicked in. As they say “The rest is history.”  </p>



<p>Tricia now owns and flies a 1988 Super Cub, and she and John
enjoy accessing the backcountry in their C-185 together, throughout the country.&nbsp; She is passionate about the outdoors and
enjoys mountain biking, hiking, skiing and just about anything you can do under
Montana’s Big Sky.</p>



<p>Tricia has always had that volunteer spirit which led her to
Special Olympics; serving on the Montana Board as well as chairing the North
American board of directors. In her spare time she also serves as the Chair of
the Montana Aeronautics Board of Directors.</p>



<p>It is the passionate volunteers that keep driving her
interest in the RAF, Tricia says. “The people and places I’ve met through the
RAF family fuel my desire to help further the mission.”</p>



<p>Anyone who’s met Tricia knows that John, her three children, a handful of dogs, and her desire to get all life has to offer keep this lady on the move.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/South-Dakota-State-Liaison-Ray-Jilek-300x300.jpg">Ray grew up on a family farm in southwestern North Dakota and moved to the Black Hills of South Dakota in the late 80s where he met Laura, the love of his life. Laura and Ray now live in Spearfish and have two daughters.</p>
<p>Ray learned to fly in a Cessna 150, then bought a C-172 in which he earned his instrument and commercial ratings. In 1996 Ray started an Aerial Application business based in Sturgis, SD and expanded into banner towing, flight instruction, wildlife surveys, and aerial predator control. In 2001 Ray and Laura purchased Eagle Aviation, Inc. at Spearfish and offer flight Instruction, charter, maintenance, and the full complement of FBO services. Ray currently owns and flies two Cessna 172s, a 206, and a recently rebuilt SuperCub, and flies corporate turbo props.</p>
<p>Ray’s passion for backcountry aviation began after several flights to Alaska and into the backcountry in the lower 48. Ray is a Life Member of the South Dakota Pilots Assoc. and understands the need for advocacy groups that support and foster aviation interests. Through Ray’s involvement with SuperCub.org, “that bunch made flights into the Missouri Breaks strips,” Ray said. “Pilots experienced firsthand the results of hard work and efforts by the RAF and MPA to re-gain access to this beautiful piece of paradise.”</p>
<p>“Through these aviation activities, many friends have been made and campfires shared,” he says. “I always have time to visit with like-minded individuals and look forward to meeting other RAF supporters as well as recruiting new interest to further the RAF mission.”</p>]]>

<p>Eventually a SuperCub on floats became his pride and joy. It became a convertible with Bushwheels, skis and floats. He credits his association with SuperCub.org for coast-to-coast friendships and finding a cadre of local</p>
<p>New England pilots, in search of the backcountry adventure.</p>
<p>John and His wife Jennifer split their work week between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. They have a home and airstrip in Wentworth, NH, affectionately known as the “WAD.” It is home to the Columbus Weekend Fly In and Fly Out.</p>
<p>John has one son and three grandchildren along with a 1956 SuperCub and a 1953 Cessna 180.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Nebraska-State-Liaison-Dan-Keller-300x300.jpg">During his freshman year in college, a “Learn to Fly Here” flyer caught Dan Keller’s eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years later&nbsp;he graduated with an ag business degree. It was post-911 and “two thousand pilots had just been laid off. My flight instructors from four years prior were still instructing,” says Dan.&nbsp;So he decided on a profession in finance instead of aviation and pegged his hopes on pursuing recreational aviation.</p>
<p>Today, Dan uses aviation in his business scouting cornfields for insurance and personally to fly back and forth to the family ranch.</p>
<p>Dan’s most memorable trips include the 2015&nbsp;SuperCub&nbsp;Fly-in at Johnson Creek, and joining Caribbean Flying Adventures in 2014 on a fly-out to Long Island in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Living in central Nebraska, he emphasizes the importance of general aviation as a time-saving way to travel.&nbsp;“Driving, we are five hours from Denver International Airport and three hours from Omaha.”</p>
<p>Recreational flying, says Dan, “is a balance between just burning fuel and finding interesting places to visit. My goal for the RAF in Nebraska is to connect pilots with unique locations allowing them to land with easy access to activities.”&nbsp; He points out that there is very little public land in his state, so he sees his task as “a liaison between pilots and private airport owners.”</p>
<p>Dan is available by email or phone and is very interested in talking about different aircraft for different missions and unique airports in Nebraska. His current experience is in an Aviat Husky and a Columbia 400.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Montana-State-Liaison-Scott-Newpower-photo-300x192.jpg">For 25 years, pilots flying into Montana’s Logan International Airport in Billings probably heard Scott Newpower in the tower. He decided on an ATC career in Hudson, WI, during college when he saw an ad in the local newspaper to become an FAA air traffic controller. &nbsp;After four years in the tower in Grand Forks, ND, he transferred to Billings. Originally from St. Paul, MN, he planned to stay in Billings only a few years and move on, but grew to love Montana and decided to stay in Big Sky Country.</p>
<p>Scott learned to fly in 1996 and he and his wife Mary began exploring the backcountry with their Cessna 182. He regularly volunteers on airstrip work parties, and one day working at Schafer Meadows, a pilot landed in a Beech Bonanza. Scott noticed the “For Sale” sign in it. Within the hour, he decided to sell his 182 and buy the Bonanza. More than ten years and many mods later, the Bonanza has taken Scott and Mary to every backcountry strip they ever visited in the 182.</p>
<p>Along the way, Scott joined the board of directors of the Montana Pilots Assoc, serving as President from 2013-2016, and winning well-deserved “Pilot of the Year” honors in 2016. He is a long-time RAF supporter.</p>
<p>Scott retired from the FAA and Billings tower in May 2014. He and Mary built a hangar home at the Seeley Lake airport (23S), about 30 miles northeast of Missoula. The beautiful turf airstrip is owned by Montana Aeronautics and Scott volunteers with his airport neighbors to help keep it maintained. Scott brings a wealth of experience and energy to the RAF in his “retirement.”</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Montana-State-Liaison-Ron-Normandeau-photo-300x272.jpg">It’s not often a volunteer shows up for an RAF project with a passion for flying the backcountry and a career of cartography behind him. Ronald Normandeau was raised in Polson, Montana, attended the University of Montana, spent 22 years with the U.S. Geological Survey and retired from the U.S. Forest Service after a career as a Cartographer/Photogrammetrist. Ron earned his pilots’ license in 1964 and proceeded to “use every method known to man to find ways to fly and finance flying,” he says. He has completed the fifteen year restoration project of restoring a 1947 Aeronca Chief and is involved in getting the no bounce landing gear to stop throwing him back into the air.</p>
<p>Ron and his wife Kathy have retired in Polson.</p>
<p>In his 22 years with the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, Ron participated in the major transition from constructing maps manually to using digital methods. The result is what you see in your GPS systems with moving maps that encompass the complete U.S.</p>
<p>Ron’s twelve years with the U.S. Forest Service in Missoula have enabled him to bring other valuable experience to the RAF, and a good rapport with the USFS.</p>
<p>Ron maintained a parallel career as a reserve officer in the Corps of Engineers in the military occupational specialty (MOS) of Topographic Engineer (21D). This career encompassed service in: 19th Special Forces (ABN), 30th Engineers, 1st Maneuver Training Command, and Commander, 379th Engineer Battalion.</p>
<p>When the State Liaison position was developed by the RAF, Ron– with his willingness and experience – was a great fit for the task in Montana. He became the RAF’s first State Liaison. Now, we are proud that he has taken the role of Public Agency Consultant.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mississippi-State-Liaison-Kevin-Barry-300x300.jpeg">“I pretty much grew up in the cockpit,” Kevin Barry says. “My father was a fighter pilot turned test pilot, and my favorite birthday present every year was to sit in the cockpit of whatever fighter aircraft Dad was flying at the time.”</p>
<p>Kevin chose the United States Military Academy at West Point over the Air Force and served as a Cavalry Officer, but his passion for flying never left him. During the Gulf War — Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm — he worked closely with military aviation assets. After leaving active duty he obtained an MS in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech, a PhD from the University of Florida, “and most importantly, gainful employment, so I quickly got back into flying again,” he says, and “I was fortunate enough to find a job that incorporated my love of flying.”</p>
<p>Since 2004 he has served as a Research Scientist and Technical Director for the Army, and flies his Cessna 172 to military bases across the country. Having added a 180HP engine, tuned exhaust, and tip tanks, Kevin has taken it from Canada to the Bahamas Out Islands; as far west as California, and many places in between.</p>
<p>Building a Carbon Cub FX-2 with his father ignited his love for backcountry flying. “I first discovered the RAF through using Airfield.Guide to find backcountry airfields to visit,” he said.</p>
<p>An avid outdoorsman, Kevin enjoys hunting, fishing, mountain biking, hiking, SCUBA diving and is a member of EAA and AOPA. He sees his new responsibility as State Liaison as the perfect opportunity to combine his passion for the outdoors with his passion for flying.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Minnesota-State-Liaison-Kirk-Hiner-300x300.jpg">Kirk Hiner, who lives in Kenyon, MN, grew up in an aviation family thanks to his dad who flew B24s out of England during World War II and then continued to fly after the war. Kirk received his private pilot license in 1976, and his commercial, instrument and CFI ratings in the 80s. Over the years as lifelong EAA members, Kirk and his dad have built 5 kitplanes together (three of which they still own) and Kirk continues to give flight instruction from time to time. Along with being a small business owner, he and his wife have three children, so having extra time on his hands is not one of his biggest problems. Despite that, he still finds time for two of his biggest interests, flying and the outdoors (fishing and hunting). When Kirk found out about the RAF mission, he wanted to get involved because he witnessed firsthand the closing of the airport where his family cabin is located. As the Minnesota liaison Kirk looks forward to helping the RAF’s mission to protect these remote airstrips from closure.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Michigan-State-LIaison-Brad-Frederick-300x300.jpg">Brad Frederick’s son taught him to fly. You read that right. The Michigan native says, “At age 55, learning to fly from my son Ed remains one of the absolute highlights of my life.”</p>

<p>Brad loves aviation so much he bought a closed airstrip in Sidnaw, MI, a remote area in the western Upper Peninsula. He reopened the historic airstrip to the public and now operates <a href="http://6y9.sidnaw.org/">Prickett Grooms Airfield</a>, (6Y9) along with a community museum. He enjoys most any outdoor activity but the three at the top of the list are fishing, flying and cutting grass on an airstrip – a duty he learned from his upbringing on a small farm. He and his wife “Diz” now live near Grand Rapids. They have three children.</p>
<p>After joining the RAF in 2011, Brad was asked to become a member of the MDOT-Aeronautic GA Committee. He also serves on Michigan’s Dept. of Natural Resources advisory panel, managing northern Lake Michigan Islands.</p>
<p>He plans to retire from his day job to work more on opening airstrips, promoting aviation and building relationships that fulfill the RAF mission.</p>
<p>“I have gotten so much enjoyment out of RAF projects I’ve worked on so far, I hope I can give back more than I’ve taken, if that’s even possible,” he says.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Main-State-Liaison-Andy-Rowe-300x300.jpg">I may be the slowest learner in aviation history as I first soloed in 1963, but did not get my private license until last summer….2010! I followed up with a seaplane rating a month or so later and am presently working on an instrument rating. I’ve owned 2 aircraft, a Champ (in 1963) which my Dad sold while I was interrupting my college years with a visit to Paris Island and Camp Lejeune, and the 180hp Skyhawk on straight PK’s that I own today. Between then and now I managed to get a degree in Art History, shoot almost 1000 TV shows accumulating more frequent flyer miles than the average airline crew, and pick up a USCG Master’s license, sailing the Atlantic from Cape Town to Spitzbergen….all of which interfered with my quest for a private license. At least, that’s my excuse, and I’m sticking to it!</p>
<p>I’m a lifelong outdoors nut whether it be hunting, fishing, sailing, diving, climbing, ice boating or wind surfing. I am amazed that the RAF has accomplished so much in such a short time. Now that I’ve gotten to know a bit about the organization, I’m not surprised and hope that we can add many Maine airstrips to the RAF’s success story.</p>
<p>I’ll have a lot of help here as my instructors, mentors and friends comprise the cream of the crop of Maine’s bush pilots and I’m looking forward to getting to work. My Dad would be proud that at the age of 69, I finally have a&nbsp;real job.</p>

His father exposed him to flying at 15 with an introduction to Ernie ‘Pete’ Billows at Trinca Airport in Northern New Jersey.&nbsp; Jeffrey soloed on his 16<sup>th</sup> birthday in a J-3 Cub on skis, landing in a cornfield. “After a year of pumping gas and washing airplanes to help pay for lessons, I passed my Private at 17 in a 50’s Cessna 172,” he said.</p>
<p>During college in upstate NY, he became involved with competitive sailing and Architecture School. After college, he continued sailing on Chesapeake Bay while starting his Architecture career and family.</p>
<p>He resumed flying in his late thirties after moving from Baltimore to Louisville, KY. Thanks to the flying club at Bowman Field, he earned his Instrument Rating in a Piper Warrior.</p>
<p>“We purchased a low-time Arrow and I enjoy flying it around the region. I also spent a great weekend on Lake Champlain earning my Seaplane rating,” Jeff adds.&nbsp; “I look forward to cross-country flights in the Arrow and working with my new friends at the RAF to advocate for Kentucky’s small grass strips.”</p>

</p>
<p>After his enlistment in the Navy, Mike earned a degree in Environmental Science and went on to start a brokerage in Eastern Oregon specializing in agricultural land and ranches. Hiring local pilots to ferry him and his clients around large ranch properties, proved to be expensive and complicated. He decided to buy a Cessna 170B and learn to fly. That was the beginning of many long friendships with interesting people and a completely different view of this great country.  Aviation changed his life and opened up many opportunities.</p>
<p>Mike is currently director of business development for Electric Conduit Construction and Midwestern Contractors. His responsibilities include customer acquisition and development, as well as marketing. His career in sales and marketing, has spanned commercial real estate, scientific publishing, oil and gas pipeline construction, and wireless infrastructure construction.</p>
<p>He has flown his 170B throughout the U.S. and as far North as Tuktoyuktuk, NWT Canada. He is a rated glider pilot, a board member of Windy City Soaring Association, and a member of AOPA, and the Illinois Pilots Association.</p>
<p>Mike lives in Glenview, IL with his wife Mari. They have four grown children.</p>

<strong>RAF Featured Supporter Carmine Mowbray</strong>
</p>
<p>If there was ever an individual who epitomizes volunteerism for the RAF, it’s Carmine Mowbray, from Polson, Montana and St. George, Utah. She volunteered to publish RAF Newsletters, worked on the pilot shelter at Ryan Field, swung a Pulaski cutting sagebrush at a Missouri Breaks airstrip, and staffed the RAF booth at trade shows.</p>
<p>A native of western Washington, she and her husband moved to Montana in 1973. They started a printing business that grew into a regional printing plant serving western Montana, and published a small chain of award-winning weekly newspapers. For nearly two decades they flew a Turbo Lance to manage their six locations around Montana. At the same time they were raising four busy kids, all of whom have grown and are starting families of their own. Mowbrays sold the publishing enterprise to a larger chain in 2000. At that time Mowbrays employed 50 people.</p>
<p>No longer tied to a business, Carmine pursued other interests. She served on First Interstate Bank’s advisory board; spent 14 years on the local Polson hospital board, and taught motorcycle safety for ten seasons. She chaired Polson’s live arts council for a dozen years, and produced an award winning radio show for Montana Public Radio. To exercise her passion for journalism she published two works of historical fiction, one of which won a national award. Of her time serving in the Montana Senate, she says, “It was a real honor and very stimulating to be surrounded with 49 type-A workaholics who love to debate.”</p>
<p>Carmine now owns a 1960 Cessna 182 equipped with a three blade prop and a Sportsman STOL. “I can reach some outstanding places with this plane. By supporting the RAF we can all work together to maintain the destinations we all are privileged to use.”</p>]]>

<p>The RAF can’t say enough about Jo Schumacher and all she does for the organization.</p>
<p>“Jo works her fanny off at Sullivan Lake, Sun ‘n Fun and other events, helping “man” the booths, cooking for RAF crews, cleaning, and organizing,” says RAF’s Tricia McKenna. “She is just a great cheerleader, supporter, and hard worker.  And just loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Jo’s volunteer work at the RAF follows a career of 21 years in the United States Air Force and Air National Guard that included duties as a heavy equipment operator, airplane crew chief, and mechanic on KC-135 tankers worldwide, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt prior to and during Desert Storm.</p>
<p>She is one of the lucky ones who can call two beautiful places home: growing up on the beaches in Southern California and in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. After getting off USAF active duty, she joined the Air National Guard and in her spare time, obtained her AA degree in Botany.</p>
<p>Jo’s love for aviation began when she was on active duty with the USAF and got a ride in the right seat of an O-2 (Cessna 337).  She went on to obtain her private license. Over the years she’s logged 350 some hours, mostly in Cessna’s.</p>
<p>When she’s not involved in all things “air,” Jo spends her time gardening, quilting, camping, and hiking. She also enjoys photography and art.</p>
<p>We love Jo and appreciate all she does for the organization.</p>]]>

<p style="text-align: left;">For a woman who works full time as a surgical nurse for the Veteran’s Administration hospital in Portland, OR it’s amazing to consider all the other things Sue Mann manages to accomplish.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each year for the past dozen, Sue and her husband Jeff have gone to Guatemala where she assists other volunteer medical providers bringing care to the medically underserved. “It’s super satisfying to me,” Sue explained. “Our eye teams return the gift of eyesight. We provide up to forty-five surgeries each day, among other procedures. The people there are incredibly appreciative.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sue has made the US Navy Reserves another career. “Up until last Spring, my duties were very demanding. I have reduced my workload in preparation for retirement,“ she says, so they can finish building their retirement home in Golden, BC where they enjoy recreating near the Canadian Rockies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what does this busy woman plan next?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Retiring will allow more time for us to fly our Husky,” she says with enthusiasm. She knew she needed to find something fulfilling to replace her work in the Navy, and came across the RAF mission on line.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“I love that the RAF adopts backcountry airstrips, taking care to keep them open for us,” she said. “That was the piece that motivated me.”</p>]]>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Drew-Lyons-New-Airplane-285x300.jpg">RAF MA and RI Liaison Drew Lyons was born and raised near Boston, always dreaming of being an airline pilot, but “life eventually had different plans,” he said. After serving in the US Army 82nd Airborne Division and finishing college, Drew finally achieved his dream of becoming a pilot, earning his PPL-ASEL in 1996 and flying when possible for the next couple of years.  Life again had different plans and he stopped flying in 1999.</p>
<p>Drew settled in Connecticut in 2000, and in June 2018, he took to the skies again and says, “It all came back very quickly, especially the love for all things aviation!”  During the summer of 2018, he made his first fly-in camping trip to Parlin Field (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/2B3">2B3</a>) in New Hampshire. Drew says, “It cemented the realization that recreational aircraft use is amazing,” leading him to discover the RAF and immediately volunteer.</p>
<p>Working in construction consulting, Drew flies as often as he can and recently purchased his first aircraft, a 1955 Piper Tri-Pacer. He looks forward to using it to continue exploring fun airstrips and camping with it.</p>
<p>Drew has rolled up his sleeves to work with the RAF’s other state liaisons in New England and the Northeast to “grow our presence and help fulfill our mission of preserving, and ultimately increasing, recreational aviation access throughout the region,” he said.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mark-Spencer-222x300.jpg">Mark has lived in Arizona since 1974 and has had a long career in the Aerospace industry beginning with Sperry Flight Systems in the early 80’s. From Sperry he moved on to W.L. Gore &amp; Associates where he was involved in microwave coaxial interconnect designs used in avionics, radar and medical devices. If you had asked Mark at age 12 what he wanted to be when he grew up he would have said “an inventor!” He is named as “Inventor” or “Co-Inventor” on 13 U.S. and European Patents so it looks like he fulfilled this dream pretty well. Mark has always been an entrepreneur owning several businesses on the side of his engineering career including an auto-body shop, photography and a small skiing and rafting tour business. In 2000 Mark ventured out completely on his own with his current business, an engineering consulting and manufacturing representative business in RF Microwave, where he is still involved heavily in the aerospace industry in Arizona and New Mexico.<br>
Mark and his wife Stefanie are both private pilots currently living in the backcountry of southeastern Arizona near an old ghost town called Pearce. Mark and Sefanie have four grown children.<br>
With the purchase of their Cub Crafter’s Top Cub, Mark got very excited about backcountry flying and jumped in with both feet and spearheaded the effort to add aviation to Arizona’s recreational use statute.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AlClaytonphoto-300x225.jpeg">Al was born in Alaska and has been stuck there ever since.  As a teenager, he got a ride in the back seat of a Super Cub to a remote hunting camp in the Wrangell Mountains, which convinced him he needed wings.  He went off to Oregon for college with a plan get smart and make money so he could afford them.</p>
<p>There he met Beth, his tolerant wife.  She thoughtfully gave him a pilot’s logbook for Christmas, apparently without realizing that the $10 book was a money gobbling monster.  There are now two and one half planes in the Clayton collection.  They include a Cessna 182 which is shared with a partner, a Cessna 170B that had been wrecked and was restored by Al and his friend Rob Tasker, and an experimental SuperCub, built by lifelong Alaskan Kirk Ellis.</p>
<p>Frequent flight destinations for Al and his family include airstrips in the Wrangell –St. Elias National Park near McCarthy, lakes and ponds of southwestern Alaska, and a small strip near Skwentna, where leopard-spotted rainbow trout abound.  These trout eat mice.</p>
<p>Al is a member of the “Pioneers of Alaska,” the Alaska Airmen Association, the Alaskan Aviation Safety Foundation, the Seaplane Pilots Association, AOPA, and EAA.  He is currently the President of Lake Hood Pilots Association and has a leadership role with the International Fellowship of Flying Rotarians.  He is President of Dairy Airpark Homeowners Association which owns an airstrip on the west bank of the Kennicott River.  As a RAF Alaska Liaison, Al is excited about the opportunity to advance its mission in the Last Frontier.</p>

<h2>Florida Liaison</h2>
<p>Amrat’s interest in aviation began as a child. He would travel frequently between the US and Singapore. Prior to the terrorist attacks in New York, security was more relaxed and Amrat was allowed into the cockpit. The pilots gave him “junior wings” and said that he had now become one of them. “It made me feel very honored. Even if it was for a brief moment, it was unforgettable,” he says.</p>
<p>After high school, Amrat served two years in the Singapore Armed Forces in the 8th Singapore Infantry Regiment as a full-time serviceman. It was in the military that he decided to pursue a career in aviation. It had never occurred to him that he could own his own plane and enjoy backcountry flying. “Owning a plane seemed like a very far-fetched dream,” he said.</p>
<p>After his military service, Amrat enrolled in Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL. While there, he attended the Tampa AOPA Fly-in and met former RAF Director Tim Clifford who was standing under the wing of a plane next to a bright orange tent. He warmly invited Amrat to the seminar on backcountry aviation. When Amrat appeared, Tim famously remarked, “I had a feeling you’d come!” And Amrat became an RAF member. </p>
<p>“Through the RAF I have had many adventures. I have enjoyed meeting people who never thought backcountry aviation would be for them. I have especially enjoyed nights around the campfire, surrounded by tents and hammocks, enjoying the company of my peers at places like Creighton Island, Arcadia, Sun n’ Fun, and others.”</p>
<p>“Aviation is a lot more than just flying from point A to point B,” he says. “As the new Florida Liaison, I’m going to be part of the concerted effort and dedication on the ground to preserve, improve and create opportunities for these experiences for all to enjoy.</p>

<p>Remember when avgas was 68¢ a gallon? Carmine was just learning to fly in a 150-hp TriPacer, and wondered how to afford to keep flying. These four decades later, she still loves flying. “I’ll give up lattés, professional pedicures and even <em>shoes</em> to keep flying,” she says. So far, it hasn’t gotten to that point.  </p>



<p>When she learned of the Recreational Aviation Foundation’s mission, she signed on, beginning by helping build the Ryan pilot shelter, and chopping sagebrush on Missouri Breaks airstrips with a pulaski. </p>




<p>Carmine was raised in western Washington, and moved to Montana as soon as she was of legal age. Her first journalism job was with the Missoula daily. She and her husband started a print shop that they built into a regional printing plant serving western Montana, and published a small chain of award-winning weekly newspapers. For nearly two decades they flew a turbo Lance to manage their six locations around Montana. They sold the enterprise to a larger chain in 2000, divorced, and she began Clarity Communications, produced an award-winning radio program, and served in Montana’s State Senate. “It’s a real honor to serve in the Legislature, and very stimulating to be surrounded with 49 Type-A workaholics who consider arguing a sport,” she adds.  </p>



<p>She has written two works of historical fiction, one about the pilots who flew from Montana to Fairbanks delivering nearly 8,000 warplanes to the Soviets during WWII. Her book website is <a href="http://authormargomowbray.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">authormargomowbray.com</a>. During summers she lives near Flathead Lake, and flies her Cessna 182 to her winter home in St. George, UT, “where it’s VFR almost every day.” </p>



<p>Merilee, one of Carmine’s four adult children flies for a major airline, as does Merilee’s husband. Carmine gets her journalism fix by serving as the RAF’s publicity liaison. “RAF leadership devotes an incredible complement of skills to the organization. I am honored to be part of the RAF, plus I get to fly my old 182 – with its Sportsman STOL – to some outstanding places and meet great people,” she adds.</p>

Since then, he has obtained his private pilot certificate and a few endorsements (tailwheel, high performance and complex), and is slowly working toward his instrument rating and commercial certificate. He enjoys anything related to backcountry flying and has managed to fit in a few fun training flights while traveling around the country, including some floatplane time in Florida, Montana, and Maine.</p>
<p>Cody has been working in the graphic design world for over 15 years and currently leads a design team at an Atlanta agency. He has also handled design of a national automotive magazine, worked as part of an in-house team for a major engineering firm, and done freelance design work for a variety of clients. In addition to aviation and design, he has a wide range of hobbies including photography, mountain biking, hiking, playing guitar and banjo, kayaking, and traveling the world with his wife.</p>

<h2>Volunteer Coordinator</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/biophotocropped-265x300.jpg">Erin’s appetite for adventure began in college. After a tame suburban upbringing in Silicon Valley, she headed north to Chico State University, where she began signing up for adventure outings. After a few burly hikes and sweaty mountain biking adventures, she was officially hooked on outdoor recreation. Since then, she’s tallied up many remarkable outdoor experiences: zip-lining in Costa Rica, snorkeling coral reefs around the island of Bonaire, backpacking in Canyonlands National Park and summiting Fourteeners in Colorado.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, Erin served as a volunteer, counting bighorn sheep for Colorado’s Division of Wildlife, planting trees for a habitat restoration nonprofit, and guiding snowshoe outings for individuals with developmental disabilities. Because of these experiences and more, Erin has a keen understanding of the passion that drives RAF’s dedicated team of volunteers.</p>
<p>Erin’s belief that people from all walks of life can reap wellness benefits from outdoor recreation has guided her untraditional career path. She’s led at-risk youth on nature hikes and served as the marketing and communications director for a nonprofit that provides outdoor adventure activities for people with disabilities. In 2017, her travel guide about Rocky Mountain National Park was published by Hachette Book Group, and the third edition debuted in 2023. Erin’s outdoor writing has appeared in numerous consumer and industry publications.</p>
<p>While she is not a pilot herself, Erin’s husband holds a pilot’s license and her father-in-law flies a Piper Warrior. Her young son enjoyed his first plane flight with ‘Grand Dad’ at age three.</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FullSizeRender-3-200x300.jpg">Aviation is in Todd’s DNA. His father was a U.S. Army flight surgeon; one grandfather a B-26 pilot during WWII, the other a crop duster. An uncle flew A-4’s in Vietnam; another uncle hunted enemy submarines in a Sea King for the Navy; yet another served as Beechcraft’s chief structures engineer for the Starship, the first all-composite business airplane. Flying is as much a part of Todd’s life now as it was for family and friends before him.</p>
<p>By day Todd is responsible for leading all Customer Experience and customer-facing activities at Cirrus Aircraft including sales, marketing, personalization, delivery, service and support, flight training; and flight operations at the Cirrus “Vision Center” in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Todd joined Cirrus in early 2008 as vice president of marketing and has led a number of innovative growth initiatives aimed at both the current aircraft owner community and developing new market segments. During his tenure, the SR22 has continued to be the best-selling airplane in its class, and worldwide market share has reached an all-time high. The latest addition to the Cirrus product line – the SF50 Vision Jet – arrives as the world’s first and only single engine personal jet and has been met with global acclaim.</p>
<p>For more than 25 years, Todd has held positions in marketing and business leadership, marketing development, international marketing communications, revenue management and sales team leadership at a range of companies from boutique businesses to Fortune 500 firms. His recent aviation experience includes work at Delta Air Lines and at CubCrafters where he led sales and marketing efforts and later presided over the company.</p>
<p>Todd holds a Bachelor of Industrial and Systems Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and a Master of Business Administration from University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Todd’s passion is recreational flying, primarily in his SuperCub, with his wife Melissa, son Clay, and daughters Anna and Cameron. The family also enjoys outdoor activities in Eastern Tennessee, having had a variety of life experiences from living in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest prior to returning to the Southeast.</p>

<h2>Treasurer and Secretary</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20140612_093018-300x169.jpg">Mike was born and raised in New Hampshire (hometown is North Conway), where his interest in aviation began early. His grandfather (Transport Pilot’s License #3926) started flying in 1913 after building his first airplane. Later he became a barnstormer where he met Mike’s grandmother Freda. Deciding it was time to settle down, they moved to North Conway in 1930 to start an airport (<a href="http://www.airfields-freeman.com/NH/Airfields_NH.htm#whitemountain">http://www.airfields-freeman.com/NH/Airfields_NH.htm#whitemountain</a>) and a family. The airport remained until 1988, but was forced to close under pressure of a growing town and taxes. Mike spent summers at the airport doing odd jobs and flying with his cousin in gliders and various aircraft. In the 70s White Mountain Airport was a destination for tourists desiring scenic flights over the White Mountains of NH in classic WACO biplanes.</p>
<p>After a tour in the Air Force as a weapons loader and some character building experiences after that, Mike attended Purdue University where he earned a degree in Computer Technology (CPT) in 1996. He met his wife Lynn while attending. In 1997 the couple moved out to Colorado and started Data Network Group (http://www.dngnet.com), a company specializing in Information Technology support services for businesses. They never strayed too far from aviation. Both were avid skydivers, jumping from all kinds of aircraft including Beech 18s, DC3s, 182s, 206s, Queen Airs, King Airs, Casas, Sky Vans, 727s, Connies, Balloons, Jet Rangers and Bell 412s to name a few. It wasn’t until 1999 that Lynn surprised Mike with a discovery flight at the local airport. Within 60 days he obtained his private pilot’s license. Two weeks later he had a tail wheel endorsement and soon realized “there were really only conventional geared airplanes.” By the spring of 2000 he had flown about 100 hours in Citabrias and decided it was time to be an owner. With five hours in an early model 180 he was on his way to pick up a “new” 1976 180 in Canada. Since then he has flown about 2,500 hours, most of it in his current 1979 F model 185. During this time, Lynn obtained her private pilot and instrument ratings as well as a pristine 1954 PA-18 SuperCub. Mike and Lynn spend part of their time in Colorado on a small ranch where they have a private airstrip and horses and the rest of it in Bigfork, MT where they have closer access to the backcountry.</p>

Before long, Jack, his wife Patricia, and Devin were all licensed and flying as one another’s co-pilots on weekends, vacations and then college shopping.</p>
<p>When Devin began flying for the Navy, Jack and Patricia left flying to see the world in their sailboat. During this time, Jack served as board member and president of another 501(c) organization with a worldwide cruising membership. After 53 countries and 11 years, they returned to the U.S. and also to flying aboard a Grumman Tiger.</p>
<p>At Sun ’n Fun in 2012, they pitched a tent and stumbled onto the RAF. Their goals of “adventure travel” by aircraft so perfectly matched the RAF mission that Jack became the Florida State Liaison and helped bring several airstrip projects to fruition.</p>
<p>After serving in that role for four years, Tylers joined the RAF Board, and Patricia served as an RAF “Vice President of Appreciation”.</p>]]>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_3865-300x286.jpg">Aloft above the Mining City of Butte, a kid seeing the grandeur of Montana’s Rockies for the first time is destined to become passionate about aviation. Those early flights in a neighbor’s Bonanza motivated young John McKenna to obtain his private pilot license at the age of 16.</p>
<p>For forty years, he’s rarely traveled any other way, accumulating over five thousand hours, many in his Cessna 185. An IFR rating is attached to his ticket, but looking out the window at the mountainous west is John’s favorite method of navigation.</p>
<p>A series of airplanes have served the McKenna family pleasure trips as well as John’s New York Life Insurance practice that has spanned 37 years. John’s wife Trish also flies and enjoys her Cub. They have three children who consider the airplane the family station wagon-it’s just “how you get there.”</p>
<p>The McKenna’s have enjoyed living in Bozeman since 1972, where a person can own their own airstrip in Big Sky Country and truly live the aviation dream. John and Trish characterize the backcountry pilot-they will pass on the fancy lunch, pressed slacks and shined shoes at the country club for the backcountry with tent, sleeping bags, well-worn hiking boots and a few groceries… and the dog.</p>
<p>John’s family also characterizes the spirit of volunteerism. In addition to serving long hours for no monetary reward as chairman of the Recreational Aviation Foundation, John and his family are passionate supporters of Special Olympics. His involvement with that organization provided relevant background for the formation of the RAF. It was this match of this passion for aviation-and his inability to wait for someone else to do it-that provided the momentum to form the RAF.</p>
<p>With a full tank of energy John looks forward to seeing where this flight will take him.</p>
<p>“It is the best journey I’ve experienced so far,” John says.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>RAF Wyoming Liaisons Lori Olson and Chris McAtee report on another successful spring work party at the Miracle Mile airstrip. RAF volunteers were joined by those from Casper and Cheyenne EAA Chapters and put in some solid work the weekend of&nbsp;<strong>April 27-28</strong>.&nbsp; This airstrip is located on the Miracle Mile section of the Platte River, known for great fishing. A US Forest Service campground with outhouse is a half mile southwest of the strip. The RAF negotiated with the BLM to open this abandoned airfield for public recreational use, and Wyoming EAA chapters have cooperated with the RAF on efforts to maintain it.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Miracle-Mile-Airstrip-1024x768.jpg">



<p>In spite of the poor weather forecast, fifteen folks braved muddy roads in their fifth-wheels, pickups, and vans to show up and help.</p>



<p>“We weathered strong winds, cold fronts, rain, and a few hours of calm to complete the work to get Miracle Mile ready for the summer flying season,” Lori said.&nbsp;“We got a lot done in a short amount of time and next year we should be able to enjoy a fun fly-in with minimal work on the strip,” she added.</p>

<![CDATA[<p> RAF Oregon Liaison&nbsp;Richard Mayes&nbsp;received a $1,400 RAF grant to advance the RAF mission with the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative (HCRC).&nbsp; The Hells Canyon National Recreation Area encompasses 652,488 acres of backcountry hugging the borders of northeastern Oregon and western Idaho. Six primitive airstrips along the Snake River are formally recognized as public use. Richard and RAF member Bill Ables are working together with the HCRC Steering Committee to protect and improve access to these six airstrips.&nbsp; Efforts are focused on volunteers maintaining the condition of the landing surface, managing weeds and invasive plants, maintaining wind socks, and policing the riverbanks and camping areas.&nbsp; Efforts also focus on improving relationships between the aviation community and other river users, by demonstrating the RAF’s&nbsp;commitment to protect the aesthetic values of the canyon. </p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dug-Bar-Airstrip-in-Hells-Canyon-1.jpg">



<p>HCRC has engaged a part-time facilitator to advance cooperation between the USFS, state agencies, commercial and recreational users, and elected officials.&nbsp;HCRC projects are funded by grants, contributions and volunteers. This RAF grant matches the amount the Idaho Aviation Association has pledged toward the facilitator’s salary.</p>



<p>A seventh airstrip, Sluice Creek, was closed due to an administrative oversight during the establishment of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. The RAF is collaborating with the IAA and the USFS on reopening Sluice Creek airstrip.  All parties believe that this objective is achievable.</p>

<p>Amy says “I adopted my aviation family through volunteering with various organizations,” and she has stepped up from her RAF Ambassador position to fulfill Liaison duties in Minnesota. “I look forward to learning the ropes from the great team of RAF volunteers,” Amy added.</p>



<p>
<br>Her passion for aviation began in high school when she began volunteering as a photographer for EAA during Airventure at Oshkosh. Thanks to an EAA scholarship, she earned her private pilot certificate a week after graduating high school. “I learned to fly in a Cub and the hook was set,” she says.&nbsp;<br>
</p>



<p>During college, Amy interned for Dakota Cub Aircraft, a high-performance Cub parts manufacturer and rebuilder. Amy then joined the team at Wipaire, the world’s leading manufacturer of aircraft floats. She led the marketing team for several years and moved into float and aircraft sales, where, “I’m paid to talk about airplanes during the work day, in addition to doing so for free in my spare time.”<br>
</p>



<p>She now owns a 1946 Piper Cub with what she calls “an identity crisis” – born a J3, converted to a PA-11, now with some PA-18 modifications. It spends most of its time on wheels, but also has floats and skis to handle the variety of upper Midwest conditions.<br>
</p>



<p>In addition to Amy’s involvement in EAA, she has experience with the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Minnesota Business Aviation Association, South St. Paul Airport Advisory Commission, and Fleming Field Aviation Association. “I’m most proud of helping to establish the Leah Jones ‘Herd o’ Turtles’ flight training scholarship through the Sentimental Journey Fly-In,” she says.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A dozen volunteers pitched in on Saturday,&nbsp;<strong>April 6&nbsp;</strong>for a work party at&nbsp;Minietta Mine airstrip in California’s Panamint Valley, just west of Death Valley National Park.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Minietta-Mine1-1024x711.jpg">



<p>The airstrip provides access to a historic mining district. “There are numerous elaborate mining-era ruins, including Lookout City atop the nearby hill,” event captain Dustin Mosher said. He reported that the Minietta volunteer cabin is open to the public, and there are many other sites of interest within hiking distance.</p>



<p>Due to BLM restrictions, only hand tools were permitted. The volunteers worked to restore the airstrip to a useable condition, focusing on the north half. Work this time removed approximately 400 feet of overgrowth from the strip and smoothed out a section where car driving had rutted it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information, contact RAF California Liaison Rick Lach at 661-345-7755; or Dustin Mosher at 714-349-0549.</p>

<p>Wendy was introduced to aviation as a five-year-old when her family transferred overseas, but she had no dream of becoming a pilot. That all changed when, as a solution to a transportation problem, she took her first flight in a single engine airplane to visit college friends. Wendy was hooked!  Just three months later, she’d earned her private pilot license and she has been flying ever since, earning more ratings along the way. </p>



<p>After moving to Utah, Wendy took her biennial flight review in a SuperCub and knew that she needed one of her own. “In 2005, I flew my Piper PA-12 – which is like a SuperCub, only better! –&nbsp; to Idaho for my first backcountry fly-in,” she says. “I was captivated by the beauty and wonder of the wilderness.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy continues to hone her backcountry flying skills in Utah, Idaho, Montana, flying across the lower 48 states and even to Baja. “I especially enjoy introducing others to backcountry aviation,” she adds.</p>



<p>Always an eager volunteer, Wendy continues to work hard helping preserve backcountry airstrips at work parties. She knows the importance of&nbsp; commenting on government actions that affect backcountry airstrips. For many years she was the “star” raffle ticket seller at Idaho’s Johnson Creek SuperCub fly-in. The proceeds were donated to organizations that preserve and protect backcountry aviation assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now that I’m retired from my chemical engineering career, I’m excited to step up to the challenge and opportunity to serve as the RAF Utah state liaison,” she says. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>Seventeen volunteers took up tools the weekend of&nbsp;<strong>March 22-24</strong>&nbsp;at Florida’s beautiful 4,000-ft turf Blackwater Airfield&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/8FD3">8FD3</a>) in the mixed pine forest near Munson, FL. Leeanna and “DC” Nowling started early by delivering tools and materials and made a truck available for the task.</p>



<p>Florida RAF Ambassador John Hall arrived, followed by Florida Liaison Bobby Capozzi and his wife Kim, Elaine Hartman in her RV6, Mike Guidry in his C177RG, and Paul Michel. The work plan was set and assignments made with just enough time to get tents up as the sun set.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blackwater-1.jpg">



<p>Saturday morning the campers awoke to ice on the tents, which surprised the Floridians. The rest of the day saw a steady rotation of volunteers coming and going including Florida Ambassador Joe DeLeon and Jenny; Joe, Katie and Jenna Campbell, Eric Bucketew, and one of our newest members, Doug Smith in his Husky. Doug originally planned on working a few hours but received the coveted kitchen pass in the 11th hour as he was buckling his seatbelt for departure.&nbsp;The kitchen pass allowed him to stay, eat and camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Blackwater refresh included installing marker tires at the north threshold. All existing tires were realigned, straightened and painted. DC produced two young painters, grandsons Jacob and Jayden. Elaine pressure washed the&nbsp;picnic tables for repairs, barbecue grills were planted and the general area was raked and cleared. The fire pit was repaired and prepped for the evening.</p>



<p>“I’d like to plan a work party like this&nbsp;once a year or as required,” Bobby said, adding, “Being a good neighbor to the Florida State Forest will go a long way.”</p>



<p>By sunset the paint had dried, the concrete cured enough to test-fire the new barbecue grills with burgers and dogs for all.</p>



<p>“I would like to thank all the volunteers for coming out and supporting this worthy cause.&nbsp; Many of you attended knowing you could not enjoy the meal or camping overnight, so this means a lot and shows your dedication to improving and preserving this special airstrip,” Bobby said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>

<![CDATA[<p>It’s a time honored New England aviation tradition that when the Alton Bay seaplane base freezes, pilots land on the ice of Lake Winnepausakee, getting their Ice Wings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New Hampshire’s new Governor, elected in 2016, was determined to shrink the State Budget – not a bad thing for&nbsp;taxpayers – but it meant Alton Bay Ice Airfield (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/B18">B18</a>) was on the potential chopping block. The possibility that the ice-landing tradition could end alarmed New England RAF members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAF New Hampshire Liaison John Meade first submitted a $2,000 RAF grant request in 2016 which was awarded, and this private “subsidy” to the state was enough to keep Alton Bay Ice airfield open. For those first two winters, the season was abbreviated, but with the help of a smaller grant, the RAF provided funds for airfield maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ice-runway-2.jpg">



<p>“2019 was a great season during which the ice was able to support aircraft for 45 days,” John reports. As of the end of February, 740 aircraft have landed this season, “which has been great exposure for the RAF Mission to preserve airfields, in this case, an ice field,” he added.</p>



<p>The New Hampshire Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division recently sent a letter thanking the RAF for its support and help in making a great ice season and retaining a tradition.</p>



<p>Perhaps the RAF needs to make one sign that says, “The RAF Supports this Icefield”.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the generosity of RAF donors, RAF Grants are available for projects that further the RAF mission. Your continued donations enable the RAF to create, preserve, and maintain airstrips for recreational access.</p>



<p>
<em>How it works:&nbsp;</em>The RAF depends on its state liaisons to identify and outline a need, and apply for a grant amount.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KentRominger-1.jpg">



<p>Our most recent grant project is Astronaut Kent Rominger Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KRCV">KRCV</a>) near Del Norte, Colorado.</p>



<p>RAF Colorado Liaison Tom Haefeli prepared a proposal and plans for a heated 20×30 building with kitchen, restrooms and shower. The covered porch area will have a table, chairs and barbecue grill. RAF members have already stepped up to volunteer labor, equipment time and building materials. Groundbreaking is expected in May.</p>



<p>Key to this $30,000 grant award is that Del Norte is an ideal hub from which to enjoy several unique flying experiences in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Morning Shadows Ranch, Sand Dunes Swimming Pool airstrip, Quarter Circle Ranch, Creede, Pagosa Springs, Castle Lakes; Grant Besley, Taos, and Murrow Field in New Mexico are all about an hour’s flying time from Del Norte. The incredible backcountry playground of western Colorado/ southeastern Utah is just a short one to two hours west. All of these airports offer hiking, biking and camping opportunities.</p>



<p>Del Norte offers amazing close-in accessible recreational opportunities that quite often appear in both national print and digital media. Surrounding the settlement are vast arrays of hiking and biking trails. Watch the RAF website for progress and completion of this exciting addition to the list of airports where the RAF has had an impact!</p>



<p>If you know of an airfield with recreational appeal that is in need of consideration, contact your RAF state liaison.</p>

<p>From a young age, a Cessna was a regular part of Bill’s life, his dad’s way to get from A to B. The family plane was a tool to support the family businesses. Bill was encouraged to learn to fly for practical purposes – not as a hobby or passion. </p>



<p>A glider ride 30 years ago changed his life. “Discovering that soaring is about the journey, not the destination, opened my eyes to an entire new world of aviation,” Bill says. That ride led to his mastery of gliders and competing in soaring contests.</p>




<p>“Eventually, I migrated back to power flight simply for the joy of flying,” Bill says. </p>



<p>Bill’s early career started in a family business, Brine Inc. In 1986 he left to start the sports equipment brand, Cascade. As Founder and CEO, he led the company from an early start-up to a dominant player in the lacrosse equipment market, exiting in 2012 after its acquisition by Bauer. Bill is the holder of over 30 patents and has a passion for finding elegant solutions to challenges. When not working with start-ups, he’s usually exploring on one of his daily drivers, a Pivot Mach 6 mountain bike, Toyota Tacoma pickup truck, and a Cessna Skywagon.</p>



<p>A native New Englander with two grown children, Bill and his wife, Joanne, live on the Island of Martha’s Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts. </p>



<p>“Flying is often just a way to get from A to B when you live on an island,” Bill says. Be assured Bill has a huge smile during the entire trip from A to B and back.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>RAF New Mexico Liaison Ron Keller learned of a proposed rule change by the New Mexico Game Commission that would have limited aircraft use, and had the potential to limit recreational aviation.</p>



<p>The Game Commission was intent on banning aerial game scouting by eliminating the long standing “48 hour rule”. The new proposal would have made it unlawful&nbsp;“for any individual, for the purpose of hunting, to locate or assist in locating a protected species from or with the aid of an aircraft or drone . . .&nbsp;during the period beginning on&nbsp;August 1&nbsp;and ending on&nbsp;January 31 . . .” &nbsp;Keller and other New Mexico pilots feared that general aviation pilots may not be familiar with hunting seasons or game unit boundaries, and could be questioned and potentially cited for flights over hunting areas.</p>



<p>Former RAF director Rol Murrow, RAF Liaison Larry Filener, and Steve Summers all went on record in opposition to the proposal at public meetings as early as summer 2017. The Commission tabled the proposal until September 2018 when they again proposed the limit in earnest. Keller issued a Call To Action, and RAF membership, New Mexico Pilots Assoc., and AOPA became engaged and responded positively.</p>



<p>The seven-member Game Commission met&nbsp;Friday, November 30&nbsp;in Roswell, NM for the final decision on rule change proposals.</p>



<p>Keller and RAF member and AOPA ASN Volunteer Ron Orozco testified. (Orozco owns a ranch airstrip and B&amp;B and was instrumental in preventing closure of Lordsburg, NM airport by working with AOPA.)</p>



<p>The Commission acknowledged receiving over 800 letters, an all-time record. Keller estimated that at least 500 opposed the aviation ban, based on the numbers provided by the presentation at the meeting. After hearing testimony, the voice vote was unanimous in favor of keeping the existing rules, thus removing the threat to recreational aviation.</p>



<p>“Several factors played into this positive outcome,” Keller said. “Our attendance at meetings, meeting with commissioners, and RAF, NMPA, and AOPA letters were vitally important. The hundreds of individual letters the commissioners received was a huge eye opener for them.” One commissioner stated publicly that he was “very impressed with the professional quality of the letters, and that they were all individually written.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAF Chairman John McKenna thanked Keller for his efforts, adding, “I hope those of you who worked on this realize the importance of your efforts. This does more than keep an ill thought-out rule off the books — it tells policy makers that the aviation community is alive, concerned and willing to stand up for what we believe is right. This counts all over the country.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>AOPA CEO Mark Baker added,&nbsp;“Congratulations to all. Accomplished with good old-fashioned grassroots hard work.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>RAF California Liaison Rick Lach learned in 2011 that Chicken Strip within Death Valley National Park was threatened with permanent closure. Over the years, seasonal washouts triggered the RAF to complete spring maintenance to return&nbsp;the strip to a safe condition.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chicken-Strip.jpg">



<p>Last summer, the NPS developed five draft Alternatives for the Saline Valley, one of which was requested by local Indian tribes, and proposed that the area be returned to aboriginal conditions, meaning the airstrip would be closed forever. Closure would eliminate the opportunity to fly in to access the palm-ringed hot springs where consistent 107 degree water invites visitors to soak – clothing optional. The only other access requires hours of travel on rocky primitive roads.</p>



<p>Rick became alarmed, because closure would run counter to the 2007 Memorandum of Understanding between the RAF and Death Valley National Park, that formalized the ongoing maintenance partnership between the two parties. The MOU was renewed in 2017.</p>



<p>Montana Liaison Ron Normandeau studied all five Alternatives, and recommended pilots support “Alternative 5”, and add a comment allowing aircraft to continue to land at Chicken Strip. The comment period specifically aimed at the airstrip closed in November, and a total of 461 comments were submitted with nine comments opposing the regulation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our input mattered” Ron said. “The Park Service is a federal entity and therefore impressed with feedback from beyond the local area.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rick spoke recently with Park Ranger Abby Wines who anticipates the Chicken Strip decision will come in May. It is hoped that Chicken Strip will be added formally to the list of sanctioned Death Valley Airports along with Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells.</p>



<p>“So far things are looking positive again,” Rick said. “I plan to contact Superintendent Mike Reynolds in January to schedule our customary spring work party at the strip,” he added.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Hells Canyon, North America’s deepest river gorge, encompasses a vast and remote region with dramatic changes in elevation, terrain, climate and vegetation. Carved by the Wild and Scenic Snake River, Hells Canyon plunges more than a mile below Oregon’s west rim, and 8,000 feet below snowcapped He Devil Peak of Idaho’s Seven Devils Mountains.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dug-Bar-Airstrip-in-Hells-Canyon-1.jpg">



<p>The Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (NRA), managed by the US Forest Service (USFS), encompasses 652,488 acres of rugged backcountry hugging the borders of northeastern Oregon and western Idaho.&nbsp; There are no roads across Hells Canyon’s 10-mile wide expanse, and only three roads lead to the Snake River between Hells Canyon Dam and the Oregon-Washington boundary.&nbsp; However, there are seven backcountry airstrips deep in the canyon along the Snake River.&nbsp; Six of these airstrips are open for public use under direction from the 2003&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd584420.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Comprehensive Management Plan</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes has been invited to join the Hells Canyon Recreation Collaborative (HCRC) whose mission is to:</p>



<p>“Work collaboratively to maintain and improve recreation access into the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area by boat, raft, foot, vehicle, horseback, aircraft and associated historical infrastructure by making recommendations to the US Forest Service; promoting a sustainable recreation experience through the involvement of a broad group”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard attended the December monthly HCRC meeting in Riggins, ID.&nbsp; The more than 35 participants at the meeting included representatives of the USFS and State&nbsp;agencies, various commercial and recreational users, and representatives of Idaho’s congressional delegation.&nbsp; Discussions included progress of ongoing infrastructure improvements at Pittsburg Landing and the need to undertake protection of the historic Kirkwood Ranch complex, downstream of the Big Bar airstrip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard is working with the HCRC Steering Committee and fellow RAF member Bill Ables to protect and improve access to the six public use airstrips.&nbsp; In collaboration with the Idaho Aviation Association, efforts are ongoing with the USFS to find an acceptable approach to reopen the seventh airstrip – Sluice Creek, which is currently off-limits.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Oregon recently gained a new backcountry airfield, developed with RAF assistance.&nbsp;The Mountain Views Airfield is&nbsp;located on a working dry wheat farm, about eight miles northwest of Condon, OR.&nbsp;The 1,650 ft x 40 ft turf runway can be challenging on hot, windy days, which are quite common in the area.&nbsp;The presence of 1,200 ft tall wind turbines adjacent to the airfield attest to the windy conditions and add a bit of spice to the approach.&nbsp; Prior to use, pilots must obtain the&nbsp;<a href="https://theraf.org/content/mountain-views-airfield-safety-briefing">safety briefing</a>,&nbsp;with due consideration of pilot and aircraft capabilities, and receive approval by the owners.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mountain-Views2.jpg">



<p>Owners Randy and Barbara Anderson operate&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22572735" target="_blank">Mountain Views airbnb</a>&nbsp;adjacent to the airfield. The upgraded four-bedroom home can accommodate up to 12 guests.&nbsp;A courtesy car is available for guests to explore the nearby Cottonwood Canyon State Park with 8,000 acres of rugged terrain — vertical cliffs carved by the Wild and Scenic John Day River, deep canyons and rocky grasslands.&nbsp;The John Day River, a 284 mile long tributary of the Columbia River, is the longest free-flowing river west of the Continental Divide. &nbsp;Steelhead fishing on the river can be outstanding. Other activities include biking, hiking and wildlife viewing. Alternatively, guests can visit the quaint town of Condon, or just enjoy the solitude and completely dark night skies.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mountain-Views1.jpg">



<p>RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes worked with the owners to create this&nbsp;recreational opportunity: identifying the optimum airfield location and runway alignment for safe approaches, aircraft parking area and access.&nbsp;Richard advised the owners of the Oregon Recreational Use Statute and provided a copy of the RAF’s&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B69ys8vuSgmOLWZXTTV5NXdxQW8/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guide for the Private Airstrip Owner</a>.&nbsp;Earthwork and drainage were planned and constructed by local pilot volunteers. Richard advised on boundary and end markings, parking and windsock placement. He completed the FAA 5010 documents for charting, and prepared the&nbsp;<a href="https://theraf.org/content/mountain-views-airfield-safety-briefing">pilot’s safety briefing</a>. The&nbsp;Andersons are excited about the opportunity to create an airfield on their property for use by the pilot community.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RAF recently learned the history of an Oregon gem, Pacific City State Airport (<a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KPFC">KPFC</a>), thanks to David Inman, vice&nbsp;president of&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/friendsofpacificcitystateairport.com/friends-of-pacific-city-state-/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends of Pacific City State Airport</a>. Nestled in the middle of a small Oregon coastal town, the airport lies near rivers, a beautiful beach, and a picturesque cape.&nbsp; Fishing dories launch directly into the surf.&nbsp; Horses traverse the miles of sandy beach, much of which is within Bob Straub State Park. The town is a mix of small-town homes and businesses.&nbsp; Family-friendly inns and five-star accommodations are within an easy walk from the airport.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KPFC.jpg">



<p>Of vital interest is that for years, the State of Oregon’s Aviation Board and Oregon Department of Aviation (ODA) considered selling or closing the airport.&nbsp; While the State claims a sale of the airport would retain public access, the Friends fear this could change.&nbsp;The Friends’ goal is to encourage the State to join together with the many supporters to make a better state-run airport, similar to the RAF’s success under the leadership of Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes at McKenzie River Bridge state airport.</p>



<p>On September 22nd, The Friends, supported by the RAF,&nbsp;organized a work party of 50 pilots, families and community volunteers — some from hundreds of miles away — to demonstrate their support for the airport.“The airport is important economically to the community, is frequently used by emergency services and recreating pilots, so our group has a mix of members,” David said. Lack of State advocacy led to neglect —trees and brush were encroaching on the Runway Safety Area, “and so began an effort to team-build with the ODA by forming a volunteer work party,” David added.</p>



<p>“The airport itself has its challenges,” David explained.&nbsp; It’s 1,875 feet long, and 300 feet shorter landing from north to&nbsp;south. The pavement is good, but just 30 feet wide.&nbsp; A road passes the north end of the runway and an estuary lies to the south.&nbsp; The ramp has parking for about five aircraft “and these spots go rapidly on a sunny weekend.&nbsp; If it has been dry for a while, parking in the grass is possible,” David said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s the Friend’s goal that Pacific City State Airport becomes a well-supported state airport and that a healthy relationship is made with the State Aviation Board and the Oregon Department of Aviation,” David said. To that end, this first work party was highly cooperative and successful. Volunteers brought tractors with brush hogs and buckets, a front end loader, chipper, dump truck, track-hoe, and many chainsaws. The ODA surveyed the property lines, provided another large chipper, a dump truck, tractor, a supervisor and crew of three.&nbsp; The community supplied discounted lodging, a staging area, snacks, lunch, a doctor, first aid, safety crew, and expert loggers.&nbsp; In all, the volunteers and ODA crew removed ten dump truck loads of chipped debris and one of garbage. Both south and north approaches were improved.</p>



<p>“This was a beautiful day with much accomplished,” David said.&nbsp; “With the help of those writing letters to the Board, donating, and volunteering support for the airport, the goal is nearer.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RAF is thrilled that the FAA officially activated Trigger Gap with a permanent identifier on September 19. Trigger Gap, (17A) is a new 3,000-ft recreational airstrip, conceived and built with RAF leadership through private donations. It lies on lands managed by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in NW Arkansas’ Ozarks above the Kings River.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The RAF enabled this to happen,” said Chad Cox, Aviation Director for the Walton Family Foundation. “The Nature Conservancy also put a lot of trust in all of us on this one and they feel like we have been good stewards,” he added.</p>



<p>The future of Trigger Gap is ensured by a long-term lease with TNC and local RAF volunteers have committed to ongoing maintenance.</p>



<p>“Our success is the result of having developed a great partnership with this international conservation organization,” said RAF Arkansas Liaison Dave Powell.&nbsp;“This new destination will broaden the community of recreational flyers. It has easy approaches and is plenty long,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Trigger-Gap-AR.jpg">



<p>Runways are 10/28 and lined with cones on 200-ft spacing. There are fire rings and typically firewood is available on site. Bring your own water. Enjoy great views of the Ozarks from this strip atop Pension Mountain, named for Civil War veterans who settled there. As a special treat,&nbsp;<a href="http://kingsriveroutfitters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kings River Outfitters</a>&nbsp;will pick you up and arrange for you to recreate on the river.</p>



<p>Trigger Gap is just 3.2 nm south of Carroll County Airport (4M1) with courtesy cars and services. Within an hour’s drive is Ridgefield, MO, and Big Cedar Lodge Resort.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, RAF California Liaison Rick Lach initiated conversation with the BLM about reopening Johannesburg Airport in California, a two-runway dirt airport which appeared on charts until the&nbsp;1970s. The airstrip served the nearby communities of Randsburg and Johannesburg, which are both functioning gold and quartz mining settlements that date back to the 1800s. Gold miners who’d previously worked in South Africa named the outpost.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/johannesburg-recent-1-1024x768.jpg">



<p>Thanks to the cooperation of the BLM, on September 15,&nbsp;the RAF organized a group of volunteers&nbsp;to re-open Johannesburg Airport, after twenty years of abandonment by all but OHV enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors to the airstrip can access a gas station via a short walk, or enjoy restaurants, bars and lodging by walking about two miles over the hill into picturesque Randsburg with its surviving original facades and buildings. September’s Western Days Celebration brings live music and vendors, and crowds can pan for gold and witness gun fights. There are also many abandoned and functioning mines in the immediate area.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/johannesburg-aerial.jpg">



<p>The renovated runway is roughly 3,500 ft AGL. The primary take-off and no-wind runway is roughly 2,200 ft long with a smooth surface. It parallels the highway and power line to the immediate south. The crosswind runway is roughly 1,500 ft long and has an upslope when landing to the south. Prevailing winds usually dictate landing on the crosswind runway, however the upslope and power line on the south end make this a poor choice for take-off. Take-offs are suggested westbound on the longer runway parallel to the road. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>RAF Ambassador Eric Davis, his father Gary, RAF Ambassador&nbsp;Joe DeLeon, and RAF Florida Liaison Bobby Capozzi were on hand to accomplish more goals at Georgia’s Creighton Island the weekend of&nbsp;<strong>July 28-29</strong>.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Creighten-1024x683.jpg">



<p>Bobby flew in 300 lbs of new grills and concrete, which were installed by Joe and Gary who also repaired the pavilion lighting and installed wooden privacy shutters on the showers and bunkhouses.</p>



<p>Eric repaired the hydraulic system on the Case loader and removed the remaining stump, allowing them to widen the run-up area on the south end of the runway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The area still requires some smoothing, but is more or less ready for use depending on aircraft type,” Eric said. In addition to the larger run-up area, it also makes available about 100 additional feet of take-off space.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Roseate-Spoonbills.jpg">



<p>Saturday&nbsp;evening, Eric boated around the island to take in the views from the inter-coastal waterway. “I saw a flock of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goldenislesmagazine.com/columns/gim_columns/roseate-spoonbills-coming-home-to-roost/article_c0b0012c-b419-11e7-9256-f7f7d67ba4b2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roseate Spoonbills</a>, which were once a threatened species,” he said. Eric’s wife Maureen is a member of the Atlanta Audubon Society and the couple is planning to host a weekend on the island during migration season. Dates TBD.</p>



<p>Eric also completed a fencing design based on input from both professionals and people who have fenced their own property. He and Bobby will explore costs and purchasing options.</p>



<p>As a safety requirement, anyone desiring to fly in during non-scheduled events MUST obtain permission from the owner. You MUST contact the owner 24-hours prior to arrival to obtain a runway report. No landings are authorized unless you have spoken with the owner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scheduled events will be posted on the Airfield.Guide website. Check for cancellations due to weather or adverse field conditions 24-hours prior to the event.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The second annual RAF/EAA&nbsp;Chapter 42 Wrangell-St. Elias National Park fly-in and maintenance party concluded successfully over the&nbsp;<strong>July 13-15&nbsp;</strong>weekend.&nbsp; A dozen airplanes participated. Exotics like a Stinson,&nbsp;Helio-Courier&nbsp;and a&nbsp;Glastar&nbsp;joined the&nbsp;Cessnas, Pipers, and others.&nbsp; Another 15 vehicles made the long trip overland including 60 miles of gravel along the historic Copper River and Northwestern Railway right of way. From 1910 to 1938, this route was used to haul ore from&nbsp;Kennicott, the world’s richest deposit of copper ore, to Cordova.</p>



<p>Now a tourist destination in the United States’ largest National Park and Preserve, the&nbsp;Kennicott&nbsp;mine buildings are a few remaining intact examples of mining company towns that once were commonplace in the Western US. &nbsp;</p>



<p>RAF Alaska Liaison Al Clayton provided cooking and picnic facilities at his meadow next to Fireweed Airstrip (OAK8), eight miles SW of&nbsp;Kennicott, which served as the gathering and camping place for the group. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Weather mostly cooperated, except on Thursday, when wind shear and turbulence in the Copper Valley turned some pilots back. “Over the weekend a total of 58 guests came and went and took part in the adventure,” Al said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Saturday, six suitable planes shuttled 16 volunteers 20 miles SE to remote and rugged&nbsp;Peavine, what Al calls “a beautiful airstrip at the base of snow-capped mile-high cliffs on National Park Service land. With chainsaws, weed whackers, and loppers, we cleared brush and trees which had encroached on both sides and ends of the landing surface, improving safety and accessibility.” Meanwhile, a separate community service work crew cleaned up the historic McCarthy Cemetery. &nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alaska-Flyin2.jpg">



<p>Pancake breakfasts began each day.&nbsp; Potluck dinners featured fresh halibut, smoked octopus, and other local treats.&nbsp; Sunday weather was fair and all who gathered made it safely home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plan to join us next year when we will improve another local public airstrip.&nbsp; Maybe the next one will even appear on a sectional!” Al said.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the&nbsp;addition of another premier recreational flying destination, the RAF held a Grand Opening&nbsp;<strong>July 7</strong>&nbsp;at Two Hearted airstrip, in Michigan’s Lake Superior State Forest.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Two-Hearted3.jpeg">



<p>“Two Hearted is a spectacular end-of-the-road destination,” RAF chairman John McKenna said, as the ceremonial ribbon was about to be cut. “A must-visit for the adventurous and competent backcountry pilot. It will not disappoint,” he added.</p>



<p>Fifteen GA aircraft flew in, three dozen or more folks enjoyed exploring the airstrip and its surroundings, including nearby&nbsp;<a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/details.aspx?id=677&amp;type=SFCG">Lake Superior Forest State Campgound</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploringthenorth.com/twoheart/rainbow.html">Rainbow Lodge</a>. RAF Michigan Liaison Brad Frederick served hot dogs and folks enjoyed picnicking in the light breeze off Lake Superior.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Two-Hearted1.jpeg">



<p>“Come for the day or camp a night or two, overlooking Lake Superior, the largest body of fresh water in North America,” Frederick says. Cell service is not reliable, “after all it’s in the ‘boonies’ of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the Land of Hiawatha and Gitche Gumee.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) is pleased to announce the public opening of Two Hearted airstrip, (6Y5) a&nbsp;new recreational destination near where Ernest Hemingway’s “Big Two Hearted River” joins Lake Superior in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The Two Hearted River is considered a premier&nbsp;US trout stream, and there is a state campground near the airstrip.</p>



<p>You are invited to the Grand Opening,&nbsp;<strong>July 7&nbsp;</strong>(weather permitting.)&nbsp;Two Hearted airstrip (6Y5) is 20 miles north of Newberry, MI and Luce County Airport (ERY) which has 100LL and Jet A.&nbsp;Currently Two Hearted is 2,200 ft x 75 ft. It has clear approaches on both ends thanks to the 2012 fire. “It’s not a pool table to land on but it’s not just for tail draggers. It was lengthened with 172s and Cherokees in mind,” Brad said. Consider prop clearance, and please see the Safety Briefing&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/content/two-hearted-river-airstrip-safety-briefing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Two-Hearted1.jpeg">



<p>You can also find information about Two Hearted on&nbsp;<a href="https://airfield.guide/">Airfield.Guide</a>.</p>



<p>CTAF at 6Y5 is 122.9</p>



<p>The closest aviation weather reporting (AWOS) is Newberry Luce County Airport (ERY), phone 906-293-2979; in the air it’s 119.525.</p>



<p>Rainbow Lodge is nearby, as is a State Forest campground, and the Chapel of the Two Heart, built by Rainbow Lodge owners Richard and Kathy Robinson. The old CCC airstrip is adjacent to the Rainbow Lodge property, and a lease to join the properties and lengthen the turf runway was approved by Michigan’s Dep’t of Natural Resources.</p>



<p>Years ago, RAF Michigan Liaison Brad Frederick learned about an abandoned Civilian Conservation Corps airstrip in the Lake Superior State Forest from Michigan Dept. of Aeronautics. Brad and his wife made the six-hour drive from their home in central Michigan, and found what he calls “typical beautiful UP jack pine forest with some maple trees mixed in,” and he was convinced there was good reason to create a safe airstrip to more easily access this recreational gem where inland lakes teem with walleye and perch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF approved a grant for half the project; challenging folks from across the country to donate the other half. The fundraiser was named “Have a Heart” and launched on Valentine’s Day, 2017. “In about thirty days we had the funds we needed,” Brad said. The contractor completed his work, and the grass grew all summer. The State Aeronautics team showed up with transit and yellow cones to lay out the new runway before snow covered the area. “Winters are long in this area, but Spring 2018 arrived, and it’s now time to open Michigan’s newest Public Use airport to all who love recreational aviation. Come visit!” Brad said.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>During his address to the AOPA crowd in Missoula, Montana, Senator Daines announced that he had just delivered a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, requesting he consider re-opening a select number of the original US Forest Service airstrips lying within the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area. Beginning in the 1930s the USFS established and used nine widely dispersed pastoral airstrips to fight fires and re-supply Ranger Stations — saving hours and hours by mule-train — until the 1964 Wilderness Act summarily closed all of them. (Schafer Meadows is Montana’s only remaining Wilderness airstrip. It lies within the Great Bear&nbsp;Wilderness, a few miles from the “Bob”.)</p>



<p>RAF Press Liaison Carmine Mowbray sat down for an interview with Senator Daines. He emphasized the importance of these airstrips to the safety and sensible management of our public forests. “The law is clear that the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to consider each, and permit access to these established airstrips,” Daines said, paraphrasing the letter. “We know access by air creates very low impact, and it’s also clear that these airstrips are especially valuable in search and rescue and fire fighting,” he added.</p>



<p>The Senator stressed that the RAF and its corps of dedicated volunteers has “proven the viability of public/private partnerships. This arrangement saves taxpayer money on maintenance to keep them in a safe condition,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

Chuck Jarecki assigned tasks, and the crew completed on Saturday what had been planned to take two days.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Work-Party2-776x1024.jpg">



<p>Montana Liaison Ron Normandeau, assisted by Margo, removed the wings from the red Tri-Fokker that Ben Ryan had constructed. The aircraft has been donated to the Museum of Mountain Flying in Missoula, and Chuck is seeing to it that the artifact arrives there safely.</p>



<p>Larry Ashcraft, ably assisted by Brett Church, cut down and skidded numerous dead lodgepole pines threatening the powerline. They then cut a pickup load of it into firewood lengths and replenished the pilot shelter supply.</p>



<p>Chris, assisted by Chuck and Carmine Mowbray, cleaned up and hauled three pickup loads of winter debris to a slash pile.</p>



<p>Mike Hines brought his brush hog and tractor and spent the entire day mowing the rough areas near the pilot shelter, the Ryan Loop Trail and the vehicle camping area.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Work-Party1.jpg">



<p>Carmine and Trish McKenna cleaned the pilot shelter and outhouse, then removed all the decorative but deteriorating fence rails.</p>



<p>Chuck and Chris put up a new “Ryan Field” signpost at the highway turnoff. Next time you see it, you can’t miss the model Cessna and American flag!</p>



<p>Tricia and Chris un-crated and assembled a donated mower, and Tricia mowed until called away for dinner.</p>



<p>Carmine grilled sandwiches for lunches and and everyone gathered in the shelter for a Sloppy Joe dinner, protected from the pouring rain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our timing was good,” Chuck said. “The hard rain held off until the start of the 5 pm happy hour.”</p>

<p>The RAF sponsored a volunteer work party at McKenzie Bridge State Airport (<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/00S">00S</a>)&nbsp;<strong>June 2 and 3.</strong>&nbsp;Approximately 40&nbsp;volunteers turned out, contributing more than 360 work hours. Most of the volunteers came from Oregon. “We also attracted two RAF members on their way from Florida to Alaska, and an RAF member who flew from Boise, Idaho specifically for the event,” RAF Oregon Liaison Richard Mayes said. Most enjoyed camping on the airfield.</p>



<p>Many volunteers drove to the site, bringing three tractors, brush clearing equipment and hand tools. They filled and smoothed rodent holes and mowed the airfield and tie-down areas and cleared brush from around the windsock, tie-downs, gates, outhouse and runway edges. The end markers, airport sign and warning signs were cleared of brush and painted; and the segmented circle repaired and painted. They repaired the broken split rail boundary fence and repaired, cleaned and painted the outhouse inside and out.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/McKenzie-Bridge-Work-Party-1024x768.jpg">



<p>“I would estimate the in-kind value of the donated materials and equipment time at approximately five thousand dollars,” Richard said “I was humbled at the positive response we received from the pilot community to this call for action. Everyone who took time from his or her busy lives to make a contribution to this effort has my sincere appreciation.&nbsp; We absolutely left the airfield in better condition than it has been in many years. I invite pilots to fly in and check it out.&nbsp; If you like what you see, please contact the Oregon Department of Aviation to share your thoughts on the work completed, and thank them for allowing the RAF to hold this work party,”&nbsp;he added.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/McK-Bridge5.png">



<p>After the work was done, folks went hiking, and mountain biking on the nearby McKenzie River trail.&nbsp; Others napped in the shade by the McKenzie River, or shared stories with new friends.&nbsp; The showing of a Godzilla movie followed a wonderful potluck barbecue dinner.</p>



<p>The RAF thanks every volunteer who made time to travel and pitch in.&nbsp; We also thank Taylor NW Construction of Bend, for donating and transporting the fill material, and Infinity Air of Albany for helping with the barbecue.</p>



<p>“The volunteers all worked very hard, but we also enjoyed the companionship of our fellow pilots who believe we have a responsibility to help preserve airfields like McKenzie Bridge.&nbsp; It would be a pleasure to continue this effort in collaboration with the ODA,” Richard wrote in his report to the Oregon Department of Aviation.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The “Miracle Mile” section of the Platte River lies between Pathfinder and Seminole Reservoirs, and is known as a&nbsp;premier fly-fishing destination in Wyoming. There’s an airstrip there, and RAF Wyoming Liaison Lori Olson organized a work party in cooperation with the Cheyenne and Casper EAA Chapters to restore the original grass strip to a surface that’s safe for aircraft access.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Miracle-Mile-Airstrip-1024x768.jpg">



<p>Twenty-five volunteers gathered over the Memorial Day weekend to help. Most of the volunteers drove to the event in order to bring the needed equipment and supplies.</p>



<p>EAA members from Chapters&nbsp;342 and 420&nbsp;“turned out in full force with big equipment, mowers, and loaders,” Lori said. “The real work was our manual labor walking the 2,600-ft runway and pulling out yucca, cactus, and hazardous clumps of vegetation.&nbsp;We also flattened ant hills,” she added, all in compliance with work guidelines the BLM had established. The group installed an RAF windsock, requiring a welder. Luckily,&nbsp;a volunteer welding teacher showed up at the event!</p>



<p>The group managed to get some recreating in, proving that the trout are big in the Platte River. Lori expects this to become an annual event. “Since the runway is in great shape, more people should be able to fly in,” she said. “So next time we do it, it will be more of a camp, fly, and fish, than work weekend!”&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Platt-River1.jpg">



<p>Colorado Liaison Patrick Romano flew in to help, and after surveying the results said, “Last time I was here, it was hard to tell the runway from the landscape. Great work Lori! Amazing! Now I have another place to take my kayak!”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Over the weekend of May 3-6</strong>, the New Mexico Pilots Association sponsored a work party at USFS Negrito Airstrip (0NM7) in New Mexico&nbsp;to replace thousands of feet of downed cattle fence surrounding the airstrip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The event was hosted by New Mexico RAF State Liaisons Larry Filener and myself; both us are also actively involved in NMPA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the RAF’s magnificent efforts in Washington, DC, special funding became available to the USFS for maintenance of their backcountry airstrips. The Gila National Forest Reserve Ranger District, led by District Ranger John Pierson, secured some of this funding to purchase the needed fence materials. A swarm of volunteers flew or drove to Negrito Airstrip during the weekend, including many RAF members. Some of the attendees were eager to mentor and others eager to learn the fine art of fence building. Five USFS employees, including Mr. Pierson, actively worked and provided oversight on the fence replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One volunteer, John Bush, flew in from California in his Cessna 170. That is admirable of itself. However, John had back surgery just a few weeks ago, and was working as hard as anyone on the fence line. It made it very hard for me to complain about my aches and pains.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Negrito.jpg">Negrito Airstrip work party



<p>Over the course of the weekend, 33 people and 15 airplanes made their way to the “Jewel of New Mexico Backcountry Airstrips”. Several&nbsp;off duty&nbsp;USFS personnel&nbsp;were able to snag an airplane ride from RAF members Chuck Denison of Wyoming, who took young wildland firefighters, and Chris Wilson of New Mexico, who took a Reserve District employee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ranger Pierson was very pleased with the work accomplished, including replacement of over 3,500 feet of fence, replacement of the South windsock, and painting of all the runway markers on runway 03/21.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One satisfying event was the posting of the “The RAF Supports This Airstrip” sign. Without the great success of RAF efforts in DC, this very worthwhile work party may never have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p> -Ron Keller, New Mexico State Liaison </p>

<![CDATA[<p>RAF Minnesota Liaison Kurt Pennuto wants to thank everyone who took time to respond to a Call To Action regarding Bowstring Airport. The impressive turnout on&nbsp;<strong>May 2</strong>&nbsp;included 43 pilots — many of whom are RAF members — a resort owner, and the videographer who produced the Bowstring Fly in video. Twelve airplanes flew in. The County also received 28 emails, letters and phone calls. All wanted Bowstring to retain its open status. “I was very encouraged that on a&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;morning, 45 people showed up to support something they love, be passionate about it and stand up and vocalize the benefits of keeping a remote airport open,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bowstring-Flyin3.jpg">



<p>Wisconsin Liaison Jeff Russell flew in to attend and said, “It’s a beautiful airport in a great location in the heart of Minnesota’s north woods and lakes area. Kurt did a great job identifying this strip as one with high recreational value and one that the RAF should be involved with.”</p>



<p>The meeting included Itasca county commissioners, airport commissioners and MN-DOT. County Commissioner Davin Tinquist represents the district, and led the meeting by saying “We want to keep this airport open.” They are supportive of the money it generates, with people flying in to recreate. But the county’s biggest issue appeared to be their perception that ownership was exposing them to liability. Evidently, the Commissioners are not aware that in 2012, Minnesota added aviation as a recreational activity to its Recreational Use Statute, providing protection to the land owner/manager. “It’s the responsibility of the pilot to make a proper decision,” Kurt observed. “That’s where I see the education piece for the county.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Complicating matters is that MN-DOT is responsible for inspecting the airport, and had noted 17 safety violations — trees that needed to be removed.&nbsp;It appeared the airport commission wasn’t consistent about reporting back how they resolved the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kurt is committed to ongoing progress, and welcomed Michigan Liaison Brad Frederick’s offer to present his success working with the state of Michigan.</p>



<p>Both Kurt and Jeff reported that the county commissioners were quite surprised by the turnout.&nbsp;“They specifically noted the RAF’s attendance and appreciated us being there,” Jeff said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The meeting served to re-establish communications between the county and the airport commission along with MN-DOT, who informed them of funding that is available for airport safety projects.</p>



<p>“There is still more work to do,” Kurt said, “but for now Bowstring is on good footing.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Mexican Mountain airstrip in southern Utah is considered by some to be the “best backcountry strip in Utah.” It lies within a Wilderness Study Area, and remains open as a “casual use” airstrip. It’s only accessible by air or on foot. Federal WSA lands are managed to retain their “primeval character and influence, without permanent improvements or human habitation.”&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mexican-Mountain-1024x768.jpeg">



<p>On Saturday, April 21, volunteers from the Utah Back Country Pilots (UBCP) — many of whom are also RAF members — landed there with their hand tools to maintain the airstrip.<br>
<br>“We found the airstrip and surrounding&nbsp;area&nbsp;to be in excellent condition,” UBCP president Roy Evans said, “so very little maintenance had to be done.” In the interest of safety, a few rocks were moved off the runway, a few bumps were smoothed with a rake and shovel, and a few tamarisk bushes in the middle of the runway were removed.</p>



<p>“We were pleased that we did not find any trash to haul out, and we saw no new disturbance in the area,” he said. They buried the small accumulation of ash from the two fire rings that have been there for decades and replaced the worn-out windsock on the existing windsock pole.</p>



<p>Several of the volunteers then flew to Keg Knoll and Temple Mountain airstrips to assess their condition for future cleanup and safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those flying in to help and enjoy the quiet camping and hiking opportunities were&nbsp;Cory Wolf,&nbsp;Wendy Lessig, Brent Rowser, Brandon Knotts, Wayne Loeber, Perry Null, Cindy Crawford, Carmine Mowbray, Pat Fagan, John Priscu, John Belz, John Clayton, Cal Brubaker, Rick Barnes, Bjorn Erickson and Roy Evans.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The small cow town of Arcadia, Florida had long neglected its airport. That began to change in 2012 when a group of volunteers formed “Friends of Arcadia Airport” or FOAA. They thought a new campground might attract fly-in visitors, but they weren’t sure where to begin since the City opposed the idea. FOAA turned to the RAF. Two RAF members flew in to visit with FOAA’s Board and a plan was hatched. The RAF would organize a fly-in hosted by FOAA during Arcadia’s annual Rodeo Weekend.&nbsp; After the event, all the pilots would flood the local newspaper and City Council members with letters describing how much they enjoyed Arcadia and its shops and restaurants.</p>



<p>The newspaper editor printed every letter along with an article about the fly-in. The City Council noticed, and FOAA’s journey began.&nbsp;Over the next five years,&nbsp;FOAA raised funds and added much sweat equity to build&nbsp;a small pavilion, two campgrounds, and a beautiful fire hub area. Their most ambitious — and expensive — goal was to add a shower block. After a major fundraising effort, including a $5,000 RAF grant, the project was completed and dedicated.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/aviation-city.jpg">



<p>The theme of FOAA’s story is one the RAF knows well: It’s the Three P’s — the Persistence and Patience of Pilots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fly in and stay awhile! Enjoy camping, hot showers, and relax around Arcadia’s fire hub knowing the Three P’s have provided them for you with pleasure!</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/city-admin-stewart-with-friends-of-Arcadia-1.jpg">



<p>These projects don’t happen without the Three P’s. The RAF’s many projects prove it — Russian Flat, the new USFS airstrip in Montana; Trigger Gap, the new airstrip on land owned by The Nature Conservancy in Arkansas; the opening of private airstrips like Sunrise Valley Ranch in Oregon; or access to beautiful state lands like Florida’s Blackwater River State Forest or North Fox Island in Michigan. The backstory of each of these successes includes repeated attendance at meetings, building relationships with officials, written proposals and the constant promotion of aviation’s form of access. Then there’s the need for funding. And FOAA is an example that demonstrates the Three P’s.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Fifteen aircraft arrived at Grand Gulch in northern Arizona for a cooperative work party on February 3, called by Utah Back County Pilots and the RAF.&nbsp; Arizona? Yes — there’s a bit of a canyon just south of this place, which makes the destination more logical for Utah pilots, since they avoid Grand Canyon Special Airspace. Galen Hanselman devoted seven pages on its fascinating history in&nbsp;<em>Fly Utah</em>. He begins, “A truly grand old mining camp deep within the no-man’s land of the Arizona Strip.” But it’s easily accessed by air, and well worth the flight and short exploratory hike. Enjoy primitive camping and the silence of true desert wilderness.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grand-Gulch-Mine-05-15-12-2-e1562162243771-1024x578.jpg">Grand Gulch, Arizona work party.



<p>You can poke around in the historic buildings and pose for a selfie in the decrepit Euclid dump trucks that were abandoned at the mine. Originally these trucks were used in the construction of Hoover Dam.</p>



<p>“We get along great with the Arizona pilot groups,” RAF Northern Utah State Liaison Steve Durtschi said. “They are pleased we’ve sort of adopted Grand Gulch.” It should be noted that Steve and Cathy Durtschi may have taken longest-distance honors, having flown their C-185 from north of Salt Lake City.</p>



<p>Perry and Sandra Null of New Mexico had already replaced the tattered windsock, and 23 volunteers picked up pulaskis, rakes, and shovels and dug in to remove encroaching plants and rocks from both runways and the parking areas. RAF Southern Utah Liaison Wayne Loeber had communicated with the BLM, and collected their sign-in sheet located on the trail to the old mine site.</p>



<p>Cal Brubaker of Salt Lake and Sky Ranch in Hurricane grilled burgers for the group, and many camped overnight. At its 4,500-ft elevation, the warm weather was most welcome.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The first of several fall/winter work parties at Georgia’s Meadowlark, (<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/GA75">GA75</a>) took place November 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Neighbors showed up with tractors and graders,” Georgia Liaison Eric Davis said. Volunteers cleared the tall brush from the north end of the runway, which opened it up to the county road, so fencing became a requirement. “So another neighbor, not a pilot, volunteered to lead the fence installation,” he added.</p>



<p>The group cleared brush from the east side of the runway, installed a new base station for ground-to-air communication, and made plans to bring the hangar lighting up to code.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GA75-1024x768.jpg">



<p>Marie-Claire LaBerge and her husband Kevin plan to run a soaring school from the field in addition to making the site available for transient and recreational pilots who want a nice place to camp. There is also an apartment in the barn that will be cleaned up and refurbished, “affording all the luxuries of home,” Eric said.</p>



<p>Future projects include creating a shooting range, tent sites, and a fire pit. Click&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.theraf.org/civicrm/event/info?id=368" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;to see the entire list of projects.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Ten volunteers responded to my last-minute call for support at Keystone Heights (42J) airport, 15 nm northeast of Gainesville. Its maintenance shed/pilot shelter — affectionately called the “Hooch Hut” — is being re-purposed for aviation-only use.&nbsp; This&nbsp;facility will support meetings, fly-ins and camping. Once completed, aviation organizations will be able to block out their event on the Keystone Heights calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The November 18 work party started with a&nbsp;survey to determine the goals for the day’s efforts and future events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christine Tilton of Florida Sport Aircraft Antique Airplane Association (FSAACA) donated material to complete the flooring.&nbsp; The interior and exterior were prepped for painting. Todd Falconer used his forklift to reposition a large concrete slab which will be used to support the outside shower.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/42J-WP-RAF.jpg">



<p>Future work parties will complete painting, installation of the shower, routing of a new water supply line, new metal roofing and concrete flooring for the pavilion areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to thank volunteers Lakin Jones, Christine Tilton, Kathy Gronbach, Albert Gronbach, Maria Hitt, Todd Falconer, Kim Capozzi, Ariel Gleason and Amrat Chugani.&nbsp; Ariel and Amrat are new RAF members who joined during the Tampa event.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RAF is pleased to report that efforts by its membership contributed to a 17% share of comments received by the Helena/Lewis and Clark National Forest during their public scoping period. These comments will steer the future travel plan on the Helena/Lewis and Clark National Forest, 2,846,606 acres of public land located in the Rocky Mountains of central Montana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, RAF Montana State Liaison Ron Normandeau sent out a Call To Action asking the aviation community to provide input during the required Forest Service Public Scoping period. RAF Director Emeritus Jerry Cain scrutinized the entire draft plan and his comment offered 20 points to best represent aviation.</p>



<p>“I verified the number of comments the Forest Service received on their website. There were about one thousand total comments, so seventeen percent would be one hundred seventy comments submitted by pilots, nationwide – a very good response,” Normandeau said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks to all who submitted comments during the scoping period. It ensures that aviation will be included in the Forest Plan and Environmental Impact Statement,” he said.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RAF and the National Park Service (NPS) officially renewed their cooperative maintenance agreement on the three airstrips within the boundaries of Death Valley National Park September 1. The original renewable five-year agreement was inked in 2008 and approved RAF volunteers performing maintenance on the Park’s airstrips. This Volunteer In the Parks, or “VIP” agreement marked the first such compact between the NPS and a pilot organization, a major step towards ensuring aircraft’s very low impact form of access to the park.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Death-Valley-Vols-1024x708.jpg">



<p>“The RAF and the NPS have have been successful partnering for nearly ten years to make access to these areas safe and available to the aviation community,” RAF board chairman John McKenna said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF works in conjunction with pilot associations from the surrounding areas to provide manpower and funds to complete projects. When Chicken Strip washed out and became unsafe after an October 2016 downpour, RAF California State Liaisons mustered volunteers and worked quickly to re-open the gravel strip. “We go into Chicken Strip each fall for maintenance,” RAF California Liaison Rick Lach said. “We pull the drag to smooth out the ‘whoop-de-doos’, and volunteers fill low spots with rakes and shovels. We have no problem rounding up twenty or so volunteers from all over California and Arizona for a work weekend,” he added. Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells are paved and the RAF pulls weeds and sees to tie-down maintenance. “It’s a real pleasure working with Karen (McKinlay-Jones, Chief Ranger) and Mike (Reynolds, Park Superintendent),” Lach added. “They have been very supportive.”</p>



<p>“The RAF is proud of our relationship with the Park Service in Death Valley and we look forward to a continued working relationship throughout the next five years of this renewed agreement,” McKenna added.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The first-ever Fly-in weekend at Carver’s Cut airstrip Aug 25-27 brought 15 planes and 30 folks to the newest recreational airstrip in California’s southern Sierra Nevadas. Guests enjoyed camping, potluck meals, trout fishing, hiking, and fellowship under the festive lights of the new pilot shelter.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Carvers-Cut.jpg">



<p>Anthony Longobardo, the RAF’s newest California Liaison, opened his new strip 10 minutes north of Kern Valley Airport (L05) for the event. At an elevation of 4,500 ft, and 1,400 ft long, it is advised for “capable airplanes only.” Anthony joins veteran RAF California Liaison Rick Lach, who he said, “had a lot to offer” about the process of creating new airstrips.&nbsp;“Rick and I answered a lot of questions about RAF’s mission and purpose,” he said.</p>



<p>“I was wearing two hats as a both an RAF Liaison and an airstrip owner,” he added. “There was conversation all weekend about airstrip development in the Sierras around Kern Field and Death Valley National Park,” Anthony observed.</p>



<p>Volunteers were directed by cabin designer/builders Walt Snyder and Chris Brown. Some leveled tent platforms, painted, mowed tiedown and airstrip weeds, and set up a safe shooting range area and prepared the ATV for guest use.&nbsp;Other airstrip founders Tom Livermore, Patrick Cox, the Silicz boys, and Dustin Mosher enjoyed seeing how much visitors appreciated the open house.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carvers-Cut-Kids.jpg">



<p>It was a very family-friendly weekend and&nbsp;the kids loved the natural rock waterslides just a few minutes’ walk from the airstrip, riding around camp in the back of the Polaris and assembling model airplanes that Brad Pinnell and Molly Varese created using scrap wood. After dark they lit glow sticks that Janice Dier brought.&nbsp;Everyone shared food and drinks, and raved over Joe Dier’s competition-level mesquite smoked ribs and chicken. A rattlesnake that met its untimely end found his way into a hearty stew.</p>

<p>Soft country music broke out around the campfire, and “brilliant starry galaxies higher than we could fly captured our hearts and confirmed to us all that we were indeed some of the luckiest people and pilots around,” Anthony concluded. &nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Sunrise Valley Ranch is an 11,000 acre working cattle ranch located approximately 40 miles by air, or 85 miles by road, due east of Bend, Oregon.&nbsp; Nestled in a small valley surrounded by the Ochoco Mountains, the ranch is owned by Larry and Susan Fildes. Three generations of their extended family live on the ranch and work alongside Larry and Susan.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sunrise-Valley1.jpg">



<p>The Fildes family enjoys sharing the beauty and solitude of the Ochoco Mountains with visitors.&nbsp; To improve access to their remote ranch, the RAF helped the Fildes to plan and develop an airstrip.&nbsp; The RAF assistance included confirming suitability of the location and airstrip alignment, identifying approach and departure routes, reviewing the Oregon Recreational Use Statute, allaying the ranch’s insurance company’s concerns, developing a pilot’s safety briefing, and preparing the FAA Forms for recording and charting the airstrip.</p>



<p>The 2,100 x 60-ft dirt airstrip was constructed with local pilot volunteer support and was opened to the public in the spring of 2017.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sunrise-Valley2.jpg">



<p>At an elevation of 4,400 feet, and surrounded on three sides by 6,400-ft mountains, the airstrip can be challenging on hot, windy days.&nbsp; Review of the safety briefing, and due consideration of pilot and aircraft capabilities, is essential before use.</p>



<p>Visitors to the ranch are welcome to camp adjacent to the airstrip, stay in the ranch’s rustic lodge, or just stop in for a delicious family style meal.&nbsp; Local pilots have already made this a favorite destination for weekend breakfast and the dining area is often crowded, so be sure to call ahead.&nbsp; Activities available at the ranch include hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking, or simply enjoying the peaceful environment.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Ben William Ryan passed away peacefully July 26 at the Montana Veteran’s Home in Columbia Falls with his loving wife Agnes, “Butchie” and friends at his side.</p>



<p>Ben began life March 21, 1923 in Belleflower, CA, the son of Ben and Mary Ryan. Ben had an older sister, T. Antoinette.&nbsp; His family moved to Three Forks, Montana, in 1931.</p>



<p>In 1932 Ben was introduced to airplanes, a relationship that would last his lifetime. Two Lockheeds landed near town. The pilot boosted young Ben up on his shoulder to retrieve the mail from the baggage compartment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben entered Stanford University in 1941 to study geology. His keen interest in petroleum engineering took him all the way to Alaska’s North Slope where he would eventually take part in the discovery of its world-changing oil field.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-Ryan-3.png">



<p>On the Friday following the Pearl Harbor attack, Ben enlisted in the Army Reserve as an aviation cadet, and went active duty in May, 1943. The Army flew in his mother – then a PFC in the Women’s Army Corps – to pin on his wings, a total surprise to the young aviator. Ben joined the 32<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Fighter Squadron in September 1944. While flying the twin Lockheed P-38 in “trail formation” the plane in front of Ben’s malfunctioned and slowed rapidly. “I barely slid under the plane, but another P-38 took my vertical stabilizer off with his wing as he evaded the slowed plane,” Ben wrote in his memoir. He had no rudder or elevator control. At 400 miles an hour, the plane went into a vertical dive. Ben had no choice but to bail out. His plane hit the water and sank in seconds. He cut his chute away before it pulled him under but his life raft would not inflate. Sharks were known in the area. Ben treaded water until a native in a sailboat pulled him out. An Army boat took Ben back to the base where an Army doctor gave him a belt of Scotch. Early the next morning, he was back in another P-38 on a formation flight.</p>



<p>In the meantime, petite little RN Agnes Butchovsky, — affectionately known as “Butchie” — was working aboard the hospital ship&nbsp;<em>Republic.&nbsp;</em>The ship broke down near the Canal and had a lengthy wait for parts. It was a “lucky break,” for that’s when a friend arranged Ben and Butchie’s blind date that would change their lives forever.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-Ryan-1024x576.jpg">



<p>After a nine-month courtship they were married in Denver on June 8, 1946.</p>



<p>In March Ben was discharged from the Army and roughnecked on an oil well near Livingston, Montana. That fall the couple returned to Stanford to get his petroleum engineering degree. Butchie worked at the Palo Alto Hospital.</p>



<p>He joined Richfield Oil Company in September and monitored wells in California. He was assigned to Wyoming to manage the Mountain States exploration, then in 1956, the Company sent Ryans to Caracas, Venezuela. Upon the ouster of Jiménez, they were transferred to Los Angeles. In 1961, they transferred to Anchorage, Alaska. With two of his fellow employees they purchased a Cessna 172. Ben enjoyed flying, hunting and fishing with a kayak he’d built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richfield was a leading explorer in Alaska and Ben’s job was to recommend where to drill. This was before the North Slope’s significance was known. Ben concurred on a report about promising oil sands south of Prudhoe Bay and recommended they act soon. Before long, men and material were moving north into what became the Prudhoe Bay oil field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben left the Company in 1965 when Richfield and Atlantic merged and Ryans moved south. The couple purchased a quarter section of timbered land above West Glacier, Montana calling it “home” after Panama, California, Wyoming, Venezuela and Alaska. Together, they constructed an A-frame home, surrounded by stunning views. Ben designed and built a sawmill from which he sawed lumber to build a shop and hangar. Always a partnership, the couple shared the challenges of living remotely in a land of heavy winter snows. Neighbors vouched for their self-reliance, even witnessing the pair repairing their heavy crawler-tractor together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early 1970s, he began clearing the dense lodgepole pine for a 2,500-foot airfield. To create the parklike finish, he acquired a road grader from his mother’s contracting and mining business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben built his first airplane in 1974. The maiden flight was in October, 1977. Butchie had helped in its construction and was not a bit hesitant to fly with Ben. He built a Fisher Classic bi-plane, then a World War I Fokker Tri-plane. There were no plans, so he simply enlarged Cleveland model airplane plans.</p>



<p>Ryans were introduced to the Recreational Aviation Foundation in 2005. Its mission to create and maintain recreational airstrips for public enjoyment resonated with them and triggered their desire to donate their property to the RAF. “Ryan Field is for everyone to enjoy,” Ben often said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The couple moved to the Montana Veteran’s Home in Columbia Falls in May of 2012. “He will be greatly missed by staff and residents,” according to the obituary prepared by the Veteran’s Home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ben is survived by his wife of 71 years Agnes “Butchie” Ryan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass is planned Tuesday, August 1 at Catholic Church in Columbia Falls at 10 am with honor guard to follow at Montana Veterans Home Cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memorials in Ben’s name may be made to the Recreational Aviation Foundation, 1711 West College St., Bozeman, MT 59715 or the charity of your choice.</p>

<p>Despite unseasonably cold and stormy weather, several hearty pilots and their passengers attended the RAF Fly-In Saturday, June 10 at Madras, Oregon (S33) to inaugurate the new grass runway.&nbsp; An early morning snow shower, followed by scattered thunderstorms throughout the weekend conspired to keep less adventuresome aviators away, but pilots came from as far away as New Hampshire, joining several from Washington, for the fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new 5,000 ft x 75 ft engineered turf runway was declared a magnificent Central Oregon destination for aircraft of all types.</p>



<p>Saturday&nbsp;evening, Rob and Tracy Berg, owners of Berg Air, hosted a barbecue dinner. Attendees shared their aviation experiences and provided feedback on the grass runway.</p>



<p>Sunday&nbsp;morning, five aircraft flew out to the Sunrise Valley Ranch to try out the newest backcountry airstrip in Oregon, developed with RAF assistance.&nbsp; The 2,100 ft&nbsp;x 60 ft dirt airstrip sits in a small valley at 4,400 ft elevation, surrounded on three sides by 6,400 ft mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larry and Susan Fildes, owners of the Sunrise Valley Ranch, hosted nine hungry visitors at their lodge.  Following an excellent family-style breakfast prepared by daughter Becky – who previously cooked at Red’s Horse Ranch – the aviators departed for home under clearing skies.</p>

<p>The RAF is pleased to report that once North Fox Island airstrip was re-opened, RAF Michigan Liaison Brad Frederick got to work on another beautiful recreational destination, this time along the Two-Hearted River in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has begun on reclaiming the airstrip, but it is not yet open to the public. Brad staked out the airstrip and your donations earmarked for this project have funded excavating equipment and crew, and seeding grass on the strip.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Two-Hearted1.jpeg">



<p>&nbsp;“The Two Hearted Airstrip cannot be used until it has been inspected by the State Aeronautics Department and the required airport license has been granted. At that time, we&nbsp;</p>



<p>can announce that it’s officially open,” Brad said. The RAF hopes this will happen late in 2017 or late Spring 2018. “It will depend on how the grass comes in and that’s up to Mother Nature,” he added.&nbsp;

<![CDATA[<p>RAF Alaska Liaison&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/team/al-clayton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Al Clayton</a>&nbsp;organized a June 3 work party to trim and remove trees along 1,000-ft Jake’s Bar, which lies within Alaska’s Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The group gathered Friday at Clayton’s rustic cabin at Fireweed airstrip, near the old mining town of McCarthy. The pilots enjoyed an incredibly scenic flight, while Al’s wife Beth and daughter Taral made the 6-hour drive from Anchorage, bringing tools, food, beverages and propane.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jakes-Bar.jpeg">



<p>After Saturday’s hearty potluck breakfast, nine volunteers in five planes made the short flight into the Park, landing at Jake’s Bar along the Chitina River, a tributary of the Copper, famous for salmon. Al had worked with Park officials to obtain the permit and guidelines for the work, and packed in chainsaws, loppers, hearing protection, a weed whacker and sandwiches. The strip was originally a staging place for mining activity, and is now ideal for recreational use. There is an old cabin, sauna and historic cache at its north end that is maintained by the Park Service and available for public use. A short trail leads to a good put-in place for rafting the Chitina. The group tracked down an old road grader abandoned in the woods.</p>



<p>Overcast but dry weather held all day Saturday, but typical Alaska spring rains began Saturday night, and low ceilings delayed departures on Sunday. Spirits were high in spite of wet tents and clothing.</p>



<p>Al thanks Bernie Willis and Ed White, volunteers from EAA Chapter 42; Matt Freeman, retired FAA;&nbsp; and Bob Waldron, Ray Huot, Jim Schaff, and Montana’s Carmine Mowbray, all from the RAF. Ray’s guest, Ralph Peters from Georgia did a great job with the weed whacker.</p>

<p>Another success in keeping with the RAF mission happened as the new Phoenix FAA sectional shows no X through the Grapevine Airstrip symbol. It’s taken nearly five years of collaboration between the&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RAF</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://azpilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona Pilots’ Association</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://azpilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">APA</a>)&nbsp;and the US Forest Service – including the signing of the national MOU between the RAF and the USFS – to remove the X that had been there for twenty years. The new identifier 88AZ appears on the chart for this Arizona airstrip located close to Lake Roosevelt.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Grapevine2.jpg">



<p>Hundreds of volunteers gave their time, monetary contributions, sweat and even&nbsp;blood, (everything has thorns in the Sonoran Desert) to make this happen. Grapevine is an example of what can be accomplished through partnering, and is a great example when working with other land managers.&nbsp;The RAF thanks USFS District Ranger Kelly Jardine for his support, and his trust in the aviation community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While designated as private, access is open to the public; with no commercial operations, no training, nor automobile access. As a symbol of&nbsp;cooperation between the aviation community and the USFS, the mutual expectation is for visitors to respect the Forest Service’s vision for the site. Please know and obey&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/tonto/alerts-notices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fire restrictions</a>, and practice&nbsp;<a href="https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leave no Trace</a>&nbsp;ethics. There are limited campsites along the eastern side of the airstrip and midfield on the west. Please do not clear new areas. Always hand pull your aircraft off the airstrip as far from the runway edge as practical. Be courteous to other campers, and keep safety in the forefront of every visit to Grapevine.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Grapevine-5-1.jpg">



<p>The final Spring 2017 weekend campout celebrated this great news with 29&nbsp;aircraft and dozens of pilots, friends and families showing up to enjoy the Sonoran desert beauty and meals prepared by volunteers Kit Murphy and Brad Lawrence.</p>



<p>Due to the limited campsites, and to provide usage information for the USFS, the APA has set up a special email address to help coordinate the limited camp spots. Please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:grapevine@azpilots.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grapevine@azpilots.org</a>&nbsp;with your questions, your tail number and desired dates. APA can neither give permission, nor limit access, but can give you an idea if sites are open during your planned stay. The port-a-john remains on site from September through May, and we will continue our third weekend camp outs and lunch&nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;during those&nbsp;months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before visiting Grapevine, please review APA’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://azpilots.org/images/attachments/GrapevineInfoPamphlet.pdf" target="_blank">safety brief&nbsp;</a>and know your and your aircraft’s limitations. As pilot in command, you are responsible for your and your&nbsp;passengers’ safety.</p>

<strong>Gila National Forest update</strong>
</p>



<p>New Mexico pilots have responded to RAF Calls To Action regarding Forest Service plan revisions and have written comments. We appreciate their time and effort!</p>



<p>Joyce and I collaborated on comments to Gila NF on behalf of NMPA, while Rol Murrow commented on behalf of the RAF. Several people have taken time to engage in face-to-face meetings with USFS personnel, including Rol, RAF New Mexico Liaison Larry Filener and myself. The Gila National Forest Planner emailed, thanking us and advising us of the incorporation of language advocating airstrips into the plan revision. Here is part of the correspondence he sent:</p>



<p>
<em>“Thank you for sharing your ideas and perspectives. We were able to add “airstrips” to the sustainable infrastructure need-for-change statement as you suggested.&nbsp; We appreciate your efforts to help us with the plan revision process. We expect to post final versions of these documents to our website (</em>

<em>http://go.usa.gov/h88k</em>
</a>
<em>) soon. Please feel free to contact us with any additional comments or questions. There will be more opportunities to collaborate and provide input during the plan development phase.”</em>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Well-Received presentation to the USFS&nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>New Mexico Liaison Larry Filener put together a Power Point, and he and I teamed up on a presentation to the Gila National Forest Team on May 17<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; We covered who the RAF and NMPA are; explained the NM Airstrip Network, recreational aviation liability issues; the RAF wildlife study; the MOUs between the RAF, the USFS and the BLM; RAF accomplishments such as Montana’s Russian Flat and Arizona’s Grapevine and Double Circle. Larry handed out copies of the RAF Land Managers Guide. We had time for Q&amp;A at the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe we laid the groundwork for further discussions around an integrated maintenance plan for all airstrips in the Gila. We received a round of applause at the end, which seemed to me to indicate the presentation went very well.</p>



<p>We learned from the Aviation Officer that USFS maintenance standards for airstrips have been discarded, so the RAF has a real opportunity to provide guidance and input in this area.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce a cooperative agreement between the RAF, EAA Chapter 42 and the National Park Service in Alaska. It’s an opportunity for a fly-in community service project to make Jake’s Bar (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/AK0" target="_blank">AKO</a>) a safer place to operate.&nbsp;The strip is an unimproved 1,000-ft gravel bar along the Chitina River in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, 13 nm south of McCarthy. The surface is rough, with softball sized rocks. No tricycle gear aircraft and only suitable tailwheels should consider landing there. Plans are to cut trees and brush and make surface improvements to make it a safer strip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In spite of 30mph crosswinds all day,&nbsp;19 volunteers accomplished everything we hoped to! We worked a Bobcat to death, and were lucky Matthew Turnage&nbsp;was able to get a second unit out to us getting the 26 holes bored out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As best I can see we got the following done:</p>



<p>• Assembled, stained and placed two picnic tables;</p>



<p>• Established a new entrance off of the road; sealed old one. The new entrance is much more accessible and&nbsp;looks great!</p>



<p>• Placed runway pattern markers around the windsock. We choose to install it showing traditional left hand pattern to work with a noise issue with neighbors.&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/content/trigger-gap-safety-briefing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trigger Gap Safety Briefing</a>.</p>



<p>• Replaced fire pits with an incredible, professional fire pit! Thanks Justin&nbsp;Shockley for your leadership and your team’s help here. The pulled roast pork was pretty amazing also!</p>



<p>• Positioned ten 4×4 posts with lantern hooks to allow hammocks to tie to adjacent trees;</p>



<p>• Split and stacked enough firewood to cover the need for the season;</p>



<p>• Buried eight tie-downs, creating two separate “cable” airplane tie-downs.</p>



<p>The RAF thanks to all the hardworking volunteers. You’ve done a lot to make Trigger Gap a more desirable destination!</p>

<p>RAF Chairman John McKenna, Vice President Jack Tyler, New York State Liaison Russ Holland, Idaho State Liaison Mike Hart, longtime RAF volunteer Dr. Paul Collins and Idaho RAF member Larry Taylor attended a full day conference on federal public lands management practices March 28 at Boise State University. The sold-out session was open to “the various voices in support and dissent” over practices to manage, protect, and preserve public lands.&nbsp; There were panel discussions “focusing on the confluence of conservation and recreation”.</p>



<p>Former Idaho Governor and former Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus opened the meeting.&nbsp; Speakers included Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden and Montana Governor Steve Bullock. &nbsp;Three Idaho County Commissioners discussed local perspectives on public lands.</p>



<p>A reception followed the all-day meeting, giving the RAF representatives an opportunity to meet and talk with other stakeholders, like the Idaho Conservation League, Idaho Outfitters and Guide Association, The Wilderness Society, Advocates for the West, and more.</p>



<p>“This was a huge learning experience for me as an RAF State Liaison and opened my eyes to the issues surrounding public lands”, according to RAF State Liaison Russ Holland.</p>

<p> Our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://theraf.org/" target="_blank">RAF</a>&nbsp;mission is to preserve airstrips, and in New Hampshire we found an unusual one –&nbsp;<em>the only FAA-approved ice runway in the lower 48.</em>
</p>



<p> When winter comes to New England, the seaplane base at Alton Bay, (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/B18" target="_blank">B18</a>) on Lake Winnepausakee starts to freeze. Local volunteers watch it closely for an ice thickness of 12 inches – the magic number that triggers contact with the NHDOT Aeronautical Division. This is normally late January or early February. Once NHDOT gives the green light, volunteers plow a 3,000-foot ice runway and adjoining taxiway and parking area. Using their own trucks, they are funded only for breakdowns and fuel. Items such as runway markers and signs are hand-me-downs from other airports. This is where the RAF and other organizations such as the New Hampshire Pilots Association stepped in. Amidst cuts in state funding, as RAF NH State Liaison, I applied for an RAF grant of $2,000 to partially fund the ice base. My application was approved. This year Paul LaRochelle heads up the volunteer team so the grant underwrites a large portion of his team’s expenses. Last weekend, I fired up the SuperCub and once again amended my bucket list to land at B18 on the ice.On February 20 we are planning an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://theraf.org/civicrm/event/info?id=311" target="_blank">RAF Day on the ice</a> and are seeking members from all over New England to attend. I will be proud to install a 3’ x 6’ sign with RAF Logo stating, “This Airstrip is Supported by The RAF”. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>Big Bar airstrip is located on the Idaho side of the Snake River within Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. Hells Canyon is the deepest canyon in North America and Big Bar is the only airstrip within that National Recreation Area.  The RAF and the Oregon Pilot’s Assoc. supported the Idaho Aviation Assoc. (IAA) to conduct autumn maintenance there Oct. 29.  Eight volunteers arrived in five aircraft from Clarkston, WA; Enterprise, OR; Lewiston, Boise and Meridian ID to assist. In cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, the IAA had installed runway markings, a windsock, and a seasonal outhouse that is removed in the spring so that summer river users don’t see it. The ambitious folks cleared brush from around the runway markers, installed a new windsock, and erected the outhouse. The weather cooperated with a lovely autumn day along the river. RAF member Judy Ables kindly provided warm food and beverages to keep the volunteers well fueled. </p>

<![CDATA[<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NM-MOU-2-1024x665.jpg">



<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) joined representatives of federal and state agencies, aviation groups, landowners, and other stakeholders at the U.S. Forest Service Regional Headquarters in Albuquerque on November 10 to sign a historic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) creating a partnership called the New Mexico Airstrip Network (NMAN). The groups will collaborate to preserve, promote, and enhance New Mexico’s growing inventory of recreational airstrips and related airports.</p>



<p>The RAF was represented by President John McKenna, Director Rol Murrow, and RAF State Liaison Larry Filener, who also chairs the New Mexico Pilots Association Backcountry Committee. Filener noted, “This MOU culminates more than four years of work and is the most significant event that has ever happened concerning backcountry and recreational flying in New Mexico.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NMAN began through a team effort involving the Aviation Division of the New Mexico Department of Transportation, New Mexico Pilots Association, and the RAF. State Aviation Director Steve Summers said, “NMAN hopes to replicate the collaboration achieved in Idaho which advanced aviation and produced positive economic impact for rural communities throughout the state.”</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mystic-Bluffs-Airstrip.jpg">



<p>New Mexico has a wide range of public and private airstrips, offering excellent recreational opportunities. However, the state has never fully capitalized on these aviation assets for providing access to hunting, fishing, outfitting, hiking, and camping. “New Mexico offers unparalleled scenic and backcountry options combined with a moderate climate and an average of 280 days of sunshine per year,” said Murrow who owns an airstrip in the Northern part of the state.</p>



<p>Initial efforts will include identifying and maintaining existing airstrips, followed by the development of a plan to add new airstrips to the inventory. The MOU establishes a framework for cooperation to implement the NMAN action plan. “MOUs create an understanding of how we can work together and share responsibilities and resources to achieve common goals,” said U.S. Forest Service Southwest Region Recreational Director Francisco Valenzuela.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NM-MOU-1.jpg">



<p>Joining the RAF at the signing were representatives from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, New Mexico Dept. of Transportation, New Mexico Tourism Dept., New Mexico Pilots Association, New Mexico Council of Outfitters and Guides, New Mexico Airport Managers Association, New Mexico Aviation Aerospace Association, and United States Pilots Association. A number of other organizations will sign on in the coming days.</p>



<p>McKenna said, “The RAF is proud of all the organizations, their staffs and volunteers who made this possible. The future of recreational flying in New Mexico will certainly be brighter as a result of this partnership. What is learned here can be applied across the nation.”</p>

Together with our partners Summit and Tailwind Foundation, we have the airport in great shape. About 100 customers, friends and family visited, some exposed to the airstrip for the first time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors enjoyed volleyball, horseshoes, beanbag throws, live music and great food. Chad Cox&nbsp;is finishing up work on the hangar to the north, and improvements to the center of the runway are next. A dozen or so camped along the airstrip and went to Byrd’s Adventure Center in Ozark, AR for breakfast. Some flew to the new airstrip at Trigger Gap before returning.</p>



<p>All in all, we feel it was a great turnout and great exposure to the recreational flying efforts we are working on.</p>

The July rains had rutted the airstrip. As a safety precaution, the Park Service closed it until maintenance could be performed to bring the surface back to a safe condition. Joseph Dier, Pat Fagan and Joseph Bork answered California Liaison <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://theraf.org/team/richard-rick-lach" target="_blank">Rick Lach’s</a> work call and drove in Friday evening to begin working at 8 a.m. Saturday, Oct 15th. The men raked and shoveled dirt from high spots back into the low spots created by the runoff.  Rick ran a drag to level the strip from side to side and along its length. As usual, Camp Host “Lizard” Lee was very helpful and supportive. The “X”s were removed and left with him for storage. The next time you’re enjoying the springs, be sure to thank Lee. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>Ragmuff is the first airstrip within the privately-held North Maine Woods to open for public use. “We’re considering this a test case, the first step in working with North Maine Woods ownership as other owners are watching,” said RAF Maine Liaison&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/team/andy-rowe">Andy Rowe</a>.</p>



<p>The source of its singular name is murky, but the beauty and proximity to recreation are clear. The west branch of the Penobscot is just a mile and a half hike and offers good fishing for brook trout and landlocked salmon. Fall is the premier time to be there – colors turn and it becomes bug-free and partridge and fishing seasons overlap.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/steve-and-simba-ragmuff.jpg">



<p>Being private land, people typically buy season or multi-day recreation passes. Although pilots fly in, it’s recommended to purchase a pass for the privilege of recreating on this land.</p>



<p>There are several airstrips, originally created by paper companies for ag planes spraying the timber for spruce budworm. “These strips could be critical in the future because the budworm is encroaching from Canada,” Rowe pointed out.</p>



<p>“Steve Mason and I have our eyes on several other strips,” Rowe added, “some with even better recreational offerings.”</p>



<p>For more information contact:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The North Fox Island work weekend on June 17-19 was a huge success according to Michigan State Liaison Brad Frederick. Seventeen aircraft brought 24 volunteers who cut brush and trees and mowed grass. RAF president John McKenna and board member Alan Metzler found their niche removing ant hills.</p>



<p>George Stevens delivered the port-a-john and assembled it.&nbsp; It was welcomed by all and used by most,” Brad said. The new mower worked great, and had been generously flown to the island by Paul Welke, owner of Island Airways in a Britten Norman Islander Aircraft, he has now flown all three mowers out to the island.</p>



<p>As of Mid-June, 45 airplanes had signed in as visitors to North Fox Island. Brad estimates that at least 50 have landed there, since some don’t sign in.</p>



<p>“This is the nicest grass airstrip I’ve ever seen,” was heard, among similar comments. Illinois State Liaison Mike Purpura summed up the appeal of the place, saying, “it was nice not to hear any manmade sounds. No trains, cars, trucks, motorcycles and no cell phones ringing. The morning alarm was simply the soft morning light spilling into the tents and birds singing.”</p>



<p>The RAF thanks Brad for his leadership in the revival and re-opening of this beautiful recreational destination, and is proud to participate in its maintenance.</p>

</p>



<p>On June 8, a letter was sent to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the FAA Reauthorization Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The letter states that aviation is vital to the U.S. economy, “contributing nearly $2 trillion in total economic activity, and supporting some 12 million jobs. Aviation manufacturing also continues to be the nation’s top net export.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Senate passed its FAA Reauthorization bill 95-3. The letter concludes with a strong request for House passage, “so that together we can address important issues and reduce the costly regulatory and certification processes that continue to stifle safety, job creation, and growth in the aviation industry.”</p>



<p>Congress must pass this critical piece of pro-GA legislation to the President’s desk by&nbsp;July 15&nbsp;when the current extension expires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Signing along with the RAF:</p>



<p>Aerospace Industries Association&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aircraft Electronics Association&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commemorative Air Force&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experimental Aircraft Association&nbsp;</p>



<p>General Aviation Manufacturers Association&nbsp;</p>



<p>Helicopter Association International&nbsp;</p>



<p>International Council of Air Shows&nbsp;</p>



<p>National Agricultural Aviation Association&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Green River Chapter of the Washington Pilots Association&nbsp;and the RAF held&nbsp;their annual&nbsp;work party at Greenwater/Ranger Creek Airport (<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/21W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">21W</a>) on Saturday, May 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About&nbsp;40 volunteers and 15 planes showed up to get the airstrip&nbsp;ready to open for the season. They cleared the runway, raked, pulled weeds and tree sprouts, and replaced windsocks. A team assembled new picnic tables that were furnished by the US Forest Service. &nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ranger-Creek.jpg">



<p>The airstrip is a state-owned, 2,875-ft paved strip at 800 ft AGL with a Forest Service campground adjacent to the runway. It lies on the west side of the Cascades, only a few miles from the base of Mount Rainier, which was very evident when flying in.</p>



<p>Everyone enjoyed a chili feed furnished by RAF and WPA-Green River member Al Banholzer.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Team effort between the Recreational Aviation Foundation and the Arizona Pilot’s Association is producing great results! The process of placing the Grapevine airstrip back on the Phoenix sectional, replacing the closed airport symbol that has marked the place of the Grapevine for nearly 20 years has begun!</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Grapevine1.jpg">



<p>In&nbsp; my mind, it seems like just last year that we had our first volunteer weekend at the Grapevine, clearing the cracks and runway edges of over 100 trees and shrubs that had made their attempt at reclaiming the airstrip to nature. Surely no volunteer from that weekend will forget the thorns and bloody mess they made of us all, and I’ll never forget DR Jardine standing there with what I could have sworn was a tear in his eye as I asked him what was wrong, “nothing, nothing, I just cannot tell you what this does for me to see all these volunteers willing to do this…” He went on to explain how lack of funding was forcing them to decommission a large number of the camp sites around the lake, for lack of funding and use, and how our group, willing to work for our vision of using the Grapevine airstrip again. There have been countless hours of volunteer work, tens of thousands of dollars in donations since then, and plenty of work left, but one thing I can say for certain is that these efforts and patience are paying off. Believe it or not, that was 2011, and Grapevine has become the most visited backcountry airstrip in Arizona, and even Forest Service Region 3 as a whole. Its unique hard surface, in a remote location, with no automobiles allowed, and only a short&nbsp;distance from the shores of Roosevelt Lake, have made it a popular place, and in many cases the only backcountry airstrip many pilots will ever visit.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Grapevine2.jpg">



<p>We’re not finished with maintenance, and APA president, Tommy Thomason has already begun the work of lining up a company to help us surface seal the runway this summer. We’ve got some funds left over from the crack sealing and I know you volunteers are just chomping at the bit to get your sleeves rolled up and help as you have thus far! In any case, when you see the call for volunteers go out, don’t count on&nbsp;someone else if you can help yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Grapevine1.jpg">



<p>As we learned with the Double Circle Ranch, now the first newly charted USFS airstrip in region 3 in decades, this process can take upwards of a year. It starts with the completion of the FAA’s 7480-1 form, which I’ll first submit to the FS, and after signature on to the FAA. This initiates an air space&nbsp;study, and upon approval, 3- 6 months, the 5010 form will be completed, and once approved, 3-6 months, the closed symbol will be removed from the sectional and the new identifier and appropriate info put in its place! Grapevine airstrip will not be without some restrictions, for example, no training, touch and go operations and such, and potentially some sort of reservation system for camping, but any restrictions will be there to secure long term safe access, and to keep the backcountry characteristics that draw most folks there. Make no mistake, the National RAF/USFS MOU was required by the Tonto Forest Supervisor before he’d here of moving this far on Grapevine before the MOU was complete. Hats off to the RAF and local pilots on this huge next step!</p>

<p>​Homesteaded by George Stevens and his Apache bride in 1878, under the Desert Lands Act, the Double Circle Ranch was once one of the largest cattle ranches in the southwest. It’s place between Willow and Eagle creeks at 4,800′ made it a coveted place by not only the ancient pueblo Indians, but by the then marauding Apaches, the most notorious being Geronimo, who even tried to bargain with General George Crook for the site.&nbsp;The early ranch was right in the path of Geronimo’s many treks from the reservation back to Mexico. On two of these treks, multiple ranch hands lay dead, a few even still lie in their graves in the cemetery at the southwest end of the runway. </p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Geronimo.jpg">Geronimo



<p>The ranch saw its hay days from around 1900 to 1936, under Kansas City cattlemen, and the Abner T. Wilson family management. The Double Circle would be the second largest employer in Green Lee County, maintain a commissary where many folks living in the Eagle Creek valley would get their supplies. With the San Carlos Apache not renewing grazing leases, on their lands that lay immediately west of the ranch, things would change dramatically for the old Double Circle.&nbsp;While among the last to go, some 20,000 to 30,000 head of cattle were slowly rounded up and shipped off in style, even reported in the press, and filmed for Hollywood newsreels. The ranch was sold to the McKinneys in 1938, who ran it as a small family ranch until1948. Ownership of the old ranch changed so fast over the next few decades that even locals lost track of it. In 1950, the then owners attempted a dude ranch, constructing the current lodge and cowboy bunkhouse, and somewhere along the way a 2,400’ airstrip was bladed in just north of these structures.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Double-Circle-Ranch.jpg">



<p>In 1989, the USFS, through a land swap, obtained ownership of the remaining acres and old ranch headquarters site. Due to lack of funding, and or interest, the site lay unmaintained, subject to all sorts of vandalism and destruction until the then Double Circle grazing permit&nbsp;holders, Doug and Wilma contacted the AZ Game &amp; Fish to ask for help through a program called Adopt a Ranch. One thing lead to another, and today, the old Double Circle is alive and well, and through cooperative agreements with between the USFS and the aviation community, its remaining structures are being cared for, and the airstrip is now&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/Z66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Z66</a>, the first newly charted airstrip on FS lands in region 3 in decades!</p>



<p>The old lodge is open to all, and quite comfortable if you have a cot and sleeping bag, and twice each year the APA and RAF hold fly in camp out, and maintenance days along with locals who have also taken on the task with the aviation community.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In its mission to preserve and create airstrips for recreational access, the RAF seeks to provide credible information during public lands management planning. In 2014, the RAF was awarded an AOPA Foundation grant toward the cost of a two-year study to determine if there are noise effects around backcountry airstrips, and if so, how these effects compare with other uses. Montana Department of Transportation provided substantial funds, matched by the RAF.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Noise-Study-5.jpg">



<p>&nbsp;The study, released March 15, concludes that&nbsp;<strong>
<em>there is no significant increase in stress levels among wildlife due to recreational aviation activity.</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>Overseen by RAF’s Environmental Science Advisory Committee chair Dr. Ric Hauer – Ph.D. of the University of Montana’s Institute on Ecosystems – U of M post-graduate wildlife biologist Devin Landry selected a suite of six Montana and Idaho backcountry airstrips; and six control sites devoid of aircraft noise. Volunteer RAF pilots flew the scientists and their equipment in to the airstrips to collect feces samples, which indicate stress levels through hormone excretions. After laboratory analysis, Landry and Hauer published an 18-page document subjected to peer-review. Titled “Effects of Backcountry Aviation on Deer Stress Physiology.”&nbsp; It summarizes:</p>



<p>“Based on the results of our study, we concluded that there is no significant increase in stress levels among deer due to recreational aviation activity (e.g., takeoffs, landings, prop noise, camping, human presence) at backcountry airstrips compared to that expressed by deer as a result of similar, but non-aviation recreational activity (e.g., camping, motorized access to campground or trailhead, human presence) at campground and recreation access sites.”</p>



<p>Dr. Hauer said, “We believe that when ethically used, recreational aircraft is one of the lowest-impact means of backcountry access.” The study reinforces this position and goes a long way toward ensuring that backcountry airstrips remain an integral form of access.</p>

<p>and RAF Director, Alan Metzler, all Montana Pilot’s Association (MPA) members as well as members of the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) ventured out to the Cow Creek airstrip north of the Missouri River along the Cow Creek drainage to sow native grass seed. Cow Creek is one of six air strips in the Upper Missouri River National Monument that the local pilots maintain under the supervision of the BLM. Last fall the BLM graded out some dangerous ruts caused by years of vehicle traffic and rain erosion and provided the local pilots with the native grass seed. The air strip will remain closed until the grass is established and pilots should check NOTAMS (Notice to Airmen) prior to flying into any of these back country strips.

<p>Great Florida weather and two great aviation organizations came together for a delightful three-day weekend at&nbsp;Melrose Landing (FD22) at the end of January.&nbsp; Florida Sport Aviation, Antique, and Classic Association (FSAACA) and the RAF co-hosted. No ice, no snow, no grey skies, just lots of camaraderie among the families from 40-plus aircraft and ten RVs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF presented a program, “What’s Next, After That Off-Airport Landing” with materials generously provided by AOPA’s Air Safety Foundation.&nbsp; Four pilot volunteers opened up their “ditch bags” to share what they carry, just in case . . . and learned a bit about what else to carry in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guests enjoyed music, fireworks, great meals served by hosts Kim and Bobby Capozzi and rubbernecking past the diverse aircraft, from LSA’s to Bi-wings and much in between.&nbsp; View member Wayne Whitley’s catchy video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQC6KnVk3Uo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a>.</p>



<p>Three more Florida RAF events are planned for March and April. Be sure to check the RAF Event Calendar.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>December isn’t typically the ideal time for a work party in Montana, but RAF’s BLM Liaison Pete Smith and some intrepid volunteers decided it was for this project. Motor vehicles had left deep ruts on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/CW0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cow Creek airstrip</a>&nbsp;within scenic&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/mappage/40">Missouri River Breaks</a>&nbsp;country. A fence was needed to restrict abuse. Working between rainstorms to land and bring in materials, RAF and Montana Pilots Assoc. (MPA) volunteers cooperated with the BLM to construct a rustic fence surrounding the remote airstrip. Smith was joined by Don Hartrich, Jeff Patnode, Tim Robertson, and&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/alan-metzler">RAF director Alan Metzler</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Breaks-Work-Party-018-1024x607.jpeg">Missouri Breaks Work Party


<p>“We finished the east end fence, thirteen sections total,” said Smith. “When the fencing material is moved to the west end, we will get to work on that.”&nbsp; “The BLM will supply the correct seed mix and our hope is to get the runway seeded and rolled yet this year”.</p>



<p>MPA president Scott Newpower, also an RAF member, pointed out that due to recent grading and lack of grass, Cow Creek airstrip is vulnerable to damage. “Expect the strip to be closed and NOTAM’ed until mid-summer 2016 or until it is determined that landing on the strip won’t cause damage,” he added.</p>



<p>The RAF collaborated with MPA and the BLM several years ago to reclaim six primitive airstrips within the Missouri River Breaks, and pilots from all over the country have enjoyed their remote beauty ever since.</p>

<p>What do you do when flying to great recreational destinations is just not enough? &nbsp;For some the answer is to pick up&nbsp;a camera and capture those moments and views to share with others.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, we lost a grand master of aviation photography Jim Wark.<br>For over 20 years Jim provided a view of our country from high above, piloting his Husky from coast to coast with an eye that could see things of interest you or I might never notice.<br>
<br>The stories he shared of logging well over 8,000 hours singlehanded flying and capturing photos, were filled with joy at experiencing the beauty of our land, sadness at the sight of both natural and human destruction and at least once the fear of descending through clouds into mountainous terrain after loss of an engine.<br>
<br>Millions have enjoyed Jim’s photos through his numerous books and most recently when his work was chosen for 5 of the 15 stamps printed in the United States Postal Service Earthscapes stamp series<strong>.</strong>
<br>
<br>From the beginning, Jim was a strong supporter of the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF), always willing to pitch in with that perfect shot needed for a project or in encouraging others to join the cause and support the mission.<br>
<br>While saddened by his passing, we are fortunate to have in remembrance, a legacy of photos that will continue to encourage pilot and non-pilot alike to take to the air for the greatest view of all.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to an abundance of willing labor, the old Double Circle Lodge in the US Forest Service Apache Sitgreaves​ Clifton District got a new porch roof May 8-10. The USFS and local support has made the Recreational Aviation Foundation’s efforts possible at the old Double Circle, and RAF’s work on the national scene helped grease the skids.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Double-Circle-4_0.jpg">



<p>The roof was our own design and we had one shot to get all the right materials, tools and hardware to the site. I really appreciated that all the wood was oiled and ready when I arrived.</p>



<p>Due to high winds in my area, I regret I had to drive in, but 15 aircraft, including two from NM flew in, and along with vehicles, brought roughly 35 people, including the Forest Archaeologist and Recreation intern.</p>



<p>Being classified as “historic preservation,” special measures and design were required to ensure a period look – no prefab metal brackets and a great deal of attention to aesthetic detail, making this more challenging than your average construction project. Thanks a bunch to all those who found other things that needed attention around the site!</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Double-Circle-5_0.jpg">



<p>&nbsp;Again, locals showed up eager to work with the “airplane folks.” One couple drove eight hours to help. Other locals provided our grill and brought the new picnic bench/tables from Costco (Thanks Darcy!)&nbsp; Mike Wilson is putting together a video documentary of the project.</p>



<p>We have also begun a friendly partnership with our new Forest Archaeologist, Eric Bredemann, of the Clifton Ranger District. Eric jumped through hoops to get this project approved by the State Historic Preservation Office in time for the weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project would not have been complete without a lot of good cooking from Diane Wisda and Rick Bosshard, and all the side dishes carried in by participants made for banquet meals.</p>



<p>Our visitor log revealed a nice reward: A three-page entry written by the great-granddaughter of Abner T. Wilson whose family ran the Double Circle for over two decades in the early 1900’s. The visitor entries indicate that a lot of folks appreciate what we’re doing to save this historic ranch.</p>



<p> Our next project may be replacing the many broken windows on the lodge, hopefully for the National Public Lands event the last weekend of September.</p>

<![CDATA[<img src="http://old.theraf.org/sites/default/files/images/Rancher%20Creek%202.jpg">



<p>The RAF joined forces with the Green River Chapter of the Washington Pilots Association and WSDOT Aviation to&nbsp;hold a Work Party and Chili Feed on May 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to clean up and open&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/21W">Ranger Creek State Airport (21W)</a>.&nbsp; This is an annual event the chapter holds at its adopted airport to prepare it for the summer flying season.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year was a resounding success as a record number of 64 volunteers participated in the activities, many of them wearing their RAF hats.&nbsp; It needs noting we had a&nbsp;wonderful turn out from local Boy Scout Troop 401 and some parents to help with the work, they contributed greatly and was good to see the youth involvement. Another record was set with the 25 aircraft flying in to the event.&nbsp;The weather especially cooperated with clear blue skies, light wind, and a very agreeable temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Paul Wolf, the State Airport Manager, brought his trailer with all the tools, safety equipment, and did a great job of supervising the work.&nbsp;The runway was checked and cleaned, new wind socks installed, visitor welcome sign board repainted, runway warning signs checked, lots of Scotch Broom and saplings pulled around the runway and safety areas.&nbsp; Another big activity of the day and looked forward to was the consuming of the large pot of Ranger Creek Chili and buttermilk corn bread muffins, supplied by G. R. Chapter and RAF member&nbsp;Al Banholzer and his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rancher-Creek-1_0-1.jpg">



<p>The bottom line is that Ranger Creek is open and ready for use.&nbsp; The runway is located in a beautiful area in the foothills of Mt Rainier alongside a Forest Service camping area with many nice campsites and walking trails.&nbsp; Please take advantage of it and enjoy your flight into&nbsp;another great&nbsp;recreational airport in Washington.</p>



<p> The airport has a very long and interesting history going back to President Roosevelt’s CCC time frame and including WWII and Korean activities.  Now operated under permit from the Forest Service, the RAF and G. R. Chapter takes great pride in helping the State maintain and preserve this historical landmark.</p>

<p>Recreational Aviation Foundation&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/john-j-mckenna-jr">(RAF) President John McKenna</a>&nbsp;and Public Lands Liaison&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/mark-spencer">Mark Spencer</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;Arizona testified on March 18 before the U.S. House Department of Interior Appropriations Committee. Their goal was to request funding for the ongoing maintenance of airstrips on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). Their prepared documents and McKenna’s verbal testimony are now part of the national record. They pointed out the historic value of BLM and USFS airstrips and their role in building and protecting U.S. infrastructure; and their continued use as recreational trailheads. “Our testimony spoke to the great aviation treasures that exist on our public lands. We spoke of how these assets – many of which are a century old – began as places to deliver goods and services to the Forest Service, and along the way provided for some recreational opportunities,” McKenna recalled.</p>



<p>The RAF delegation testified that currently, volunteers who use the airstrips generally provide upkeep and maintenance. “We told Congress we are happy to do our share and more, but suggested that airstrips be recognized as places that – like trails and campgrounds – would benefit from greater interest by the public agencies who own them,” Spencer added.</p>



<p>“The RAF has become officially recognized as a trusted partner on matters relating to recreational and backcountry aviation. We believe it raises the awareness of both the people we represent, and the policymakers who govern our public lands,” McKenna said.&nbsp; “Accomplishing a budget item will be a marathon effort, but we’ll provide the energy to keep this initiative moving forward to preserve these airstrips,” he added.</p>

<![CDATA[<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/arcadia-pavilion.jpg">



<p>It’s become pretty obvious that, if you own a tent and a plane, one of the best weekends to be had is&nbsp;<a href="http://foaa.us/huge-success/">Arcadia’s&nbsp;Rodeo Weekend</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://skyvector.com/airport/X06/Arcadia-Municipal-Airport">Arcadia Municipal X06</a>&nbsp;is this typically small rural airport next to this ‘time stood still’ small Florida town, so what’s the big deal?&nbsp; Well….the ‘big deal’ comes in two packages.&nbsp; It coincides with&nbsp;<a href="http://arcadiarodeo.com/">Florida’s oldest professional rodeo</a>, 87 years young in 2015.&nbsp; The action found down in the dirt where the hooves and bluejeans mix it up is pretty entertaining.&nbsp; But it’s the second package that impresses even more:&nbsp; the new&nbsp;<a href="http://foaa.us/airport-camping/">Fly-in/Camp-out aircraft campsite</a>&nbsp;that’s been created by&nbsp;<a href="http://foaa.us/">Friends of Arcadia Airport.</a>
</p>



<p>‘Friends’ goal for over four years now has been to breathe life into their quiet airport and, by extension, into Arcadia itself.&nbsp; And central to that goal has been to create a pilot shelter and aircraft campground that lure in those of us who seek a quiet campsite after an enjoyable flight…but who might also want a half gallon of milk available nearby or want a pizza delivered.&nbsp; After a long hot summer of work, what Friends has created is a shady aviation oasis:&nbsp; a semi-circular taxiway through Florida greenery that allows one to taxi right into a shady campsite, with a central fire pit nearby and the portalettes carefully hidden from view.&nbsp; This site first became “home” when a large mix of RAF members, three generations deep, arrived to park, play, relax and share in the home cooked meals served by Friends.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arcadia-9.jpg">



<p>For all that’s been accomplished, there’s still a missing piece:&nbsp; the shelter facility itself.&nbsp; Friends has been busily hosting (amazingly popular) pancake breakfasts and hustling donations from the locals for several years now, and they thought they were getting close to funding the construction of a 20’ x 30’ shelter for seminars, socials and a place to sit when eating a meal.&nbsp; But that abruptly changed when members of the&nbsp;<a href="http://fsaaca.org/">Florida Sport Aviation Antique &amp; Classic Association (FSAACA)</a>&nbsp;presented Friends with a $1,000 shelter donation at Saturday’s dinner.&nbsp; When George Chase, Friends’ President, recovered the power of speech, he noted, “I think that puts us over the top!”</p>



<p>Arcadia’s Fly-in/Camp-out facility will be open to the public for regular use very soon, and the RAF will be sure to keep its members posted.&nbsp; But meanwhile you’ll know where to find many of us next March, because we’ll be in Arcadia, hoping to back the plane underneath an oak and waiting for Friends dinner bell to ring.&nbsp; (Want to see what YOU missed?&nbsp; Watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CShoc-DoY8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this</a>.)</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) brought two major initiatives to fruition on a mid-March trip to&nbsp;Washington, D.C.. RAF&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/john-j-mckenna-jr">President John McKenna</a>&nbsp;and Public Lands Director&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/mark-spencer">Mark Spencer</a>&nbsp;completed national Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) documents with the US Forest Service&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(USFS)</a>&nbsp; and the Bureau of Land Management&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(BLM)</a>. The stated purpose of the USFS MOU is to:</p>



<p>
<strong>“develop a framework for cooperation between the Forest Service and the RAF relating to support of Forest Service airstrips programs, including support for the operation, rehabilitation, maintenance, and public use of existing backcountry airstrips; assisting in collecting and sharing information about backcountry airstrip recreation opportunities; and enhancing recreation opportunities through funding, volunteerism and sharing technical advice. Collaboration under this MOU can occur at the national, regional, and local levels through mutually beneficial programs, projects, training and other activities that may be planned and accomplished on NFS lands by the FS and the RAF. Such programs, projects and activities will complement the respective missions of the Parties and serve the mutual interest of the parties and the flying public.”</strong>
</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/USFS.jpg">



<p>“After eight years of dedication, the RAF is celebrating this enormous accomplishment,” McKenna said. The MOU follows on the heels of the USFS Final Planning Rule Directives released in February that form the basis for aviation use on 193,000,000 acres of National Forests. The new directives were largely the result of the constant RAF advocacy for the aviation community. “Now with this formal MOU, we are ready to roll up our sleeves to maintain, preserve and create backcountry airstrips in Forest Service locations,” Spencer added.</p>



<p>
<strong>Framework for aviation formed with BLM –</strong>
</p>



<p>The RAF delegates also secured a national MOU with the BLM. Over six years in the making, this MOU is the first of its kind and recognizes aviation and how it relates to the 245,000,000 acres of BLM lands. In summary, the MOU’s stated purpose is to:</p>



<p>“<strong>establish a framework for collaboration between the BLM and the RAF relating to the responsible use of recreational airstrips on BLM-managed lands and to serve the mutual interest of each party and the flying public. Both parties agree to collaborate in identifying opportunities and possible locations throughout the country for the RAF to pursue its mission.”</strong>
</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The RAF cannot be more pleased with these accomplishments and that we are considered a trusted partner on matters relating to recreational and backcountry aviation. Were it not for the efforts of many before us – the numerous pilots and aviation organizations that have dedicated time and effort to represent aviation as a good steward of public lands – our accomplishments would have been much more difficult to attain,” McKenna said.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF), through participation in US Forest Service (USFS) public comment sessions and attending meetings of the&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=1437&amp;qid=391165">Federal Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;as observers, has secured the documenting of aviation within the Final Planning Directive (FSH 1909.12). The document acknowledges recreational aviation in multiple places. These aviation references clarify and solidify aviation as a legitimate mode of access, and one of the three legs of the National Forest Transportation System.</p>



<p>Aircraft access on National Forest lands is critical to the RAF mission of “…preserving, maintaining and creating public use recreational and backcountry airstrips nationwide.” The RAF was founded in 2003 after the closures of some stunningly scenic USFS airstrips in the west. In examining the problem, it was apparent that our public lands planners included travel plans for off-road vehicles, pack animals, bicycles, hikers and boaters, but airplanes were conspicuously missing. The RAF began by building relationships with the USFS, beginning with District Rangers and later with RAF leadership traveling to our nation’s Capital and building trust with policy-makers.</p>



<p>For years, the RAF has persevered. Volunteers attended specific Forest Plan meetings, wrote letters and continued to meet face-to-face from the backcountry of Arizona to marble-walled offices of Washington D.C..&nbsp; On February 3, their hard work resulted in the formal inclusion of aviation, airstrips and aircraft in the USFS Final Planning Directive.</p>



<p>What does this mean to pilots? With responsible use of the backcountry airstrips on National Forest lands, we can be sure of continued access and enjoyment.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/eric-davis">RAF Georgia Liaison Eric Davis</a>&nbsp;responded to a recent plea to help airlift close to 1,000 endangered turtles from New&nbsp;England beaches to facilities in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. What better way to help these slow-moving creatures get to rehab centers quickly than by Bonanza?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some GA pilots donate their services transporting dogs from overcrowded shelters to loving homes, and some GA pilots help creatures who are closer to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Our specific mission was to relay two 50-lb. Loggerheads and fourteen 10-lb. Kemps from Richmond to Jekyll Island’s Sea Turtle Center,” Eric explained. Jekyll Island airport manager, and great friend of the RAF, Rich Van Iderstyne provided support and ground transportation. He provided overnight accommodations to a pilot and his son who made the long trip from Boston in a PA-28 with 30 turtles onboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mission is a long way from completed, Eric says. “There are hundreds more turtles that need to be moved from Boston. That’s where the pilot community has stepped up.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric was able to get a short video of the turtles being unpacked:</p>

<p>“It’s selfless acts like these that make being a member of the flying community so rich and rewarding,” Eric concludes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, maybe not exactly international, but with 25 aircraft, including a brand spanking new Cessna Caravan and 50&nbsp;plus people, anyone would have wondered what was going on at the USFS Pleasant Valley&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/24AZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(24AZ)&nbsp;</a>airstrip this weekend.&nbsp; When the USFS reached out to the aviation community to ask for volunteers we thought eight to ten volunteers showing up would have been a success, but thanks to our willing and eager aviators we were able to staff four separate work teams on Saturday morning and after receiving instruction from USFS Range Manager Doug Ruppel and Recreation Technician Gary Lollman, we were off to clear brush, make fence repairs, and even build a new field gates near and around the area. I felt like a greenhorn working with Mike and Jim, two long time and professional rancher/pilots, and learned some skills that will prove useful around my little spread here in Cochise County. I think every participant felt privileged to work side by side with our hard working USFS personnel who set the pace for us.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pleasant-Valley-4.jpg">



<p>It wasn’t all work and no play as we made our way back to midfield for lunch at Diane’s kitchen, that’s Diane Wisda, and her willing assistants who set up a shade and set tables for lunch. Diane’s famous sloppy joe’s and beans were served, and man they hit the spot! Diane tells us over 40 people were served.&nbsp; After lunch it was time to give locals a bird’s eye view of their little town and the surrounding country side. I lost track, but I think we managed to get a dozen or so locals up in the air, and I know everyone will remember little 8 year old Iona and here irresistible smile. The Hunt family also showed up in force, and offered to help us out with some materials to fill some developing ruts at the east end of the airstrip. We were even joined by District Ranger Kelly Jardine from the Tonto Basin District and our beloved Grapevine airstrip.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pleasant-Valley-5.jpg">



<p>After relaxing around the campfire for a couple of hours, it was off to town for dinner at the incredible Antlers restaurant.&nbsp; Eight of us who arrived on Friday enjoyed dinner at Antlers that night, but 26 of us, including 5 locals that took a liking to us, made it out on Saturday night. All I can say is what a meal, and what a great time. Chef Scott and his wife Pam really know how to set a table for guests, and that’s exactly how one feels when enjoying dinner at Antlers. A few made their way to the Pleasant Valley Inn, and one couple to the Cherry Creek Lodge for the night while others snuggled up in tents at the airstrip.</p>



<p>It takes hours and hours to organize this sort of event. This includes the time, fuel, and efforts of our camp hosts, Jim &amp; Diane Wisda, Mike Andresen, locals, Carl Guilliams, Chuck Freegard, Barry Dille, and our photographer, Mike Wilson, but I don’t think there was a one of us that would not say “What an incredible weekend !” &nbsp;I know I am always amazed at the satisfaction I feel as one of these events comes together in the Arizona Backcountry and my hat is tipped to all of you for making this weekend such a success!&nbsp;</p>



<p>A great big thank you to Tommy Thomason and Jeff Wilson for providing so many first time flights to the local community members that came out!</p>



<p>I am looking forward to seeing you all at the Grapevine airstrip December 19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 21<sup>st</sup>!&nbsp; I know our host Mike Andresen is planning a good lunch for us, and the Saturday night Dutch Oven cook off is always incredible, so bring your best recipe!&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Mexican Mountain back country air strip over the years has grown in with weeds and debris. The Back Country Pilots Association with the help and support of the Recreational Aviation Foundation started a project to make repairs to the strip. Steve Durtschi, President of the Back County Pilots Association and RAF Utah state liaison hired Bonner Brumley and his crew to work on the Mexican Mountain Airstrip repair project. Durtschi, three years ago started working to get permission from the BLM to repair the Mexican Mountain airstrip and make it safer for pilots landing there.</p>



<p>The Brumley crew traveled to the trailhead three and half miles from the Mexican Mountain Airstrip on Sept. 20. There the crew unloaded equipment, sorted out their equipment and made up heavy packs that were then loaded on the mules for a short journey to the airstrip. They camped and worked at the airstrip for 10 days. The Brumley crew is made up of Professional Trail Builders. Bonner Brumley, Tyler Bransford and Tagge Viter of White Bird Idaho arrived Friday evening September 19 at the Huntington Airport pulling a horse trailer hauling two mules, two Airedale dogs along with a pickup load of camping gear and trail construction equipment to restore the Mexican Mountain Airstrip.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mexican-Mountain-9.jpg">



<p>Bonner Brumley said he and his crew usually work for the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho and Montana building and repairing Wilderness trails. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason mule drawn equipment was used for this project is because the airstrip is in the Mexican Mountain Wilderness Study Area. The mules were used not only as pack animals but they pulled the equipment to plow up and smooth the soil of the airstrip</p>



<p>The big Belgian mule Ellie was used to pull an implement known as a Trail Ace (developed by Bonner Brumley) to break up mountain soil. Other parts of the runway material had to be broken up with a pick and shovel before it could be moved around. The dirt was generally moved from place by members of the crew carrying two buckets filled with dirt suspended from a wooden yoke across their shoulders. The men also used grubbing hoes, mattocks and their hands to remove tamarisk and other shrubs from the runway.</p>



<p>Durtschi said Wilderness Study Areas are part of the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976. This little airstrip was built in 1975 and predates that law and is allowed to continue to exist. There is no road to the airstrip. The nearest road is three and a half miles away. The Wilderness Study area is being managed as if it was wilderness and is controlled by wilderness guidelines and work ethics. Bonner Brumley’s specialty is working in wilderness areas.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mexican-Mountain-1.jpg">



<p>This is a plan where the citizens proposed that this airstrip is an important resource for pilots who come from all over the country to land at this runway, campout and enjoy the scenery. Automobiles and other vehicles are kept away at the trailhead. “We proposed to the BLM that we have to make the runway safer for pilots. Over the years the Back Country Pilots Association has built up a budget for this project. The project has gone through the required processes. The BLM wrote an environmental assessment. The proposal has gone through the public scrutiny of hearings and comment periods and finally the BLM said you could move forward with this project. They also said do not do anymore than you said you would do” said Durtschi.</p>



<p>Bonner estimated they moved the equivalent of six to eight dump truck loads of material. This was all accomplished with two mules and three men.</p>



<p>The work of restoring the runway was similar to a two-foot wide trail 20,000 feet long. Or like two miles of trail two foot wide. He also estimated they leveled out about 20,000 square feet of surface removing the lumps that would ruin an airplane. Part of that restoration was to repair 500 foot of the airstrip that had gone back to nature with shrub like vegetation.</p>



<p>Lee Jeffs of Castle Dale was on hand to offer horses for carrying people and supplies from the trailhead to the airstrip. A week or two before this event Jeffs took Durtschi, Brumley and Leon Defreiz to the airstrip using horses. There they were able to review what was going to be needed. Durtschi reported he and his wife Cathy flew down on Friday morning to the Mexican Mountain Airstrip.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mexican-Mountain-7.jpg">



<p>Then on Tuesday flew to the Huntington Airport to get supplies and back to the Airstrip on Wednesday. They were there for eight or nine days. Durtschi said we brought the trail team in and they cleaned the existing runway. Part of the runway had been unusable. They widened the runway to its original full width. They removed the weeds, the clump grass and tamarisk off of both sides. They graded the two parking areas and filled in two low spots that get muddy with fill from the side. The runway used to be over 1,450 feet long and is about 1,800 feet long now. The cost of this project to the Back Country Pilots Association was approximately $13,000.</p>



<p>“We felt this project was very worth while because Mexican Mountain is one of the premier back country landing strips. Pilots come from all over the country to land there. Our object was to not only make it safer, but to make it better,” said Durtschi.</p>

<p>We accomplished everything we’d planned and more this weekend at the old Double Circle Ranch and airstrip. (Eagle Creek.) Nine aircraft and about twenty-two folks including personnel from the US Forest Service came to&nbsp;support the work. Local ranchers Jean and Erik Schwennesen, Jacob Cannon, ranch hand from the old 4-Drag Ranch and Dave Krejci, showed up. Jean Schwennesen, summer intern for the Clifton District, also filled the role of USFS volunteer coordinator. Local ranchers sent over their gas grills, generators and necessary tools. Cub Crafter’s AZ dealer Rick Bosshardt drove from Phoenix to provide all our heavy hauling and food, and man did we eat!&nbsp;Ron Keller of NMPA and NM DOT Aeronautics Division blessed us with a full dinner of homemade green chili brats.</p>



<p>We oiled both the lodge and the bunk house, cleaned both structures completely, and installed an incredibly beautiful new counter top provided by the USFS that Recreation Tech Micah Miller had milled himself from a fallen ancient alligator juniper. It is three-inch thick by 12 feet long and solid. &nbsp;We’ll be heading back in a week or two to seal it for use. We re-positioned a huge juniper fence post at the gate to the airstrip, and mowed much of the parking area.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Double-Circle-6.jpg">



<p>Seventeen folks spent both Friday and Saturday night with movie night in the lodge Friday night. Great thunderstorms rolled through on Saturday night, but visitors were happily tucked away in the lodge building, fireplace going, enjoying great conversation and friendship. I wish to thank everyone from&nbsp;<a href="http://azpilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AZ Pilots’ Assoc</a>. and others who pitched in to help.</p>



<p>The USFS has approved the window project that we will try to complete this winter with the porch roof tentatively scheduled for April.</p>



<p>We sure hope to see all of you at Double Circle one of these days. Follow links to a safety briefing and informational pamphlet online under the Resources tab at:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://azpilots.org/" target="_blank">azpilots.org</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Beautiful Sullivan Lake in the northeast corner of Washington State (09S) was the site of another perfect weekend fly-in Aug. 15-16. Affectionately dubbed the “Gopher Gaggle” in years past by the late Bob Kay, it’s the annual work weekend, coordinated by the RAF and Washington State Dep’t of Transportation WSDOT. Folks flew in to help WSDOT staffers perform maintenance, noting that each year the airfield needs fewer repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At noon on Saturday, the entire group of WSDOT attendees, pilot volunteers and guests assembled at the main fire pit to commemorate Bob, who served as the RAF Washington State Liaison until his sudden death in March.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sullivan-Lake-2014-6-1024x683.jpg">



<p>Tristan Atkins, WSDOT Director of Aviation and Paul Wolf, WSDOT Airports Manager unveiled a bronze plaque dedicated to Bob and all his efforts on behalf of Washington State airport preservation. As Jo Schumacher stood to accept the honor in Bob’s stead, the men announced it would be mounted on a special kiosk at Sullivan Lake.</p>



<p>Dave Whitelaw of Grand Coulee Dam, in Okanogan County, has accepted the position of RAF Washington State Liaison, saying, “Bob’s passing was a huge loss for everyone. He is irreplaceable. He did such a great job for the RAF, I was fortunate to be able to work beside him for the last couple years. There is no way I can replace him or ‘fill his shoes’ — I only hope to able to represent the RAF as well as he did.”</p>



<p>Nearly 50 RAF donors and supporters enjoyed steaks and fresh corn thanks to the campfire cooking skills of Dave Whitelaw and his brother John. Guests contributed a huge array of potluck salads. RAF board member/treasurer Tim Clifford entertained with his guitar until past dark.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Sacramento, Calif.</strong>&nbsp;—Governor Jerry Brown has signed into law&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/sites/default/files/20130SB107296CHP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 1072</a>, which amends the California Recreational Use Statute (RUS) to include recreational aviation. Since the RUS now protects landowners from liability arising from recreational use of their property, airstrip owners will likely be more receptive to transient pilots.</p>



<p>​California becomes the 24th state to include such language in its laws The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) is spearheading an effort to amend RUS language in states nationwide. The bill enjoyed strong support from the California legislature and passed both the Senate and the Assembly with&nbsp;<a href="http://openstates.org/ca/bills/20132014/SB1072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zero no votes in opposition</a>.</p>



<p>“California is such an important aviation state and this is not only an important day for California but a very big day for aviation,” said&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/john-j-mckenna-jr">RAF President John McKenna</a>. “The RAF is excited about the momentum this creates to meet our goal of having the RUS passed in all states.”</p>



<p>
<a href="http://district18.cssrc.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senator Jean Fuller</a>&nbsp;(R–Bakersfield) sponsored the bill. She and her husband are both private pilots and recognize the value of general aviation for their 250-mile commute to the state capitol as well as their recreational activities.&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/team/john-kounis">RAF state liaison John Kounis</a>&nbsp;worked with Senator Fuller’s office to provide aviation-specific research and background information throughout the legislative process. Representatives from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aopa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://calpilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Pilots Association</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.calairports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Association of California Airports</a>&nbsp;also helped rally support for the bill. “It is a win for both airport owners and for pilots who now have more recreational opportunities in the state,” Kounis said.</p>



<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation is a public 501(c)3 non-profit organization formed to “preserve, maintain and create public use recreational and backcountry airstrips nationwide,” 1711 W. College, Bozeman, MT 59715,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theraf.org/">www.theraf.org</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Saturday August 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;was a perfect day to mow a little grass, trim a few weeds, tighten some fence wire, cut some&nbsp;firewood and clean the outhouse. So, that is just what a group of volunteers did this past weekend at&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/russian-flat-airstrip">Russian Flat, MT (M42)</a>&nbsp;in central MT. The group, led by Pete Smith of the Central (Lewistown) Hangar of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.montanapilots.org/" target="_blank">Montana Pilots Association</a>&nbsp;saw ½ dozen airplanes and 12-15 people come to put some effort into this newest USFS strip. The entire strip was mowed and is in good condition.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Russian-flat.jpg">


<p>Like all good work parties there was plenty to eat thanks to Pete’s sister who made pulled pork sandwiches and cole slaw.</p>



<p>The construction of Russian Flat airstrip was started in 2008 and the airstrip was opened to the public on August 20, 2010 after countless hours of meetings and construction work. The result of all this work is the first new airstrip on US Forest Service Land in 45 to 50 years. Russian Flat continues to improve and is a great destination for an overnight or longer.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) is pleased to announce today’s decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that largely upholds the backcountry airstrip designations on Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument. The RAF and Montana Pilots’ Association mobilized early on in the Bureau of Land Management planning process to retain the airstrips.</p>



<p>“This is the vital role the RAF plays in preserving recreational use airstrips on public lands. This outcome matches our mission perfectly,” observed John McKenna, RAF President. “We are relieved to see the Ninth Circuit support the BLM’s reasonable approach for the continued use of six airstrips in the Monument,” McKenna added.</p>



<p>The Monument was created by President Clinton during his final days in office in January of 2001, and comprises about 375,000 acres and 149 miles of the Missouri River. The BLM Management Plan did not authorize new impacts, but applied some restrictions to long-existing uses of the Monument such as roads and airstrips. A suit challenging the resulting plan was filed by preservation groups led by the Montana Wilderness Association and The Wilderness Society, triggering RAF and MPA action to file as intervenors in the district court proceedings. The Missouri River Stewards and Fergus, Phillips, Blaine and Choteau counties joined in defending BLM’s management plan.</p>



<p>“We have worked many years alongside the Bureau of Land Management and other interests seeking a balanced management plan that can be a model for other Monuments,” McKenna concluded.</p>



<p>The Ninth Circuit did rule in the preservationist plaintiffs’ favor on a single narrow issue, directing BLM to conduct a more intensive “Class III inventory” of the roads, ways and airstrips designated for continuing use. Costs of appeal are normally applied in favor of the prevailing party, but the Court specifically ordered each party to bear its own costs.</p>



<p>The aviation groups are represented by Paul Turcke of Boise, Idaho, and Rob Cameron of Helena. A copy of the Court’s decision may be viewed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/07/31/11-35818.pdf" target="_blank">HERE.</a>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ryan-Work-Party2-776x1024.jpg">



<p>Volunteers began showing up Friday, and began working in spite of the drenching rain. Crews filled low spots on the 2,500’ long runway and removed brush encroaching on the field. Crews cleared property lines and felled dead timber, bucking it up for firewood.</p>



<p>Saturday’s campfire chat ended about dusk, because everyone was exhausted from a long day of work. They all showed up again wearing their work gloves and smiles on Sunday morning.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ryan-Work-Party1.jpg">



<p>Several flew in – one from as far as Pennsylvania – and camped beneath their wings, enjoying the use of the pilot shelter and wood cookstove. Some folks chose to drive – one from Jackson, WY – and the motorhomes and campers parked snugly along the timber’s edge.</p>



<p>As always, pilots are required to obtain a&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/ryan-field-safety-briefing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety briefing</a>&nbsp;and acknowledgement prior to flying to&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/ryan-field-pilot-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Field</a>.</p>



<p>A special thank you&nbsp;to Ande LaRoche of Marion, MT for&nbsp;Saturday night’s brats and dutch-oven vegetables for 30 hungry helpers.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Recreational Aviation Foundation Arkansas&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">State Liaison</a>&nbsp;Dave Myrick reports that after sending a copy of the RAF newsletter and website links to another Arkansas pilot, he received some exciting news.</p>



<p>“The phone call made my day,” Myrick said. “It was RAF member David Ellison of Bradford. He knew of our success with the Arkansas <a href="http://old.theraf.org/news/2010/update-state-recreational-use-statutes-they-pertain-aviation">Recreational Use Statutes (RUS)</a> amendment and decided to call me.”</p>



<p>Ellison had flown as an ag pilot for 16 years when he decided to turn his passion for aviation in another direction. He told Myrick that he plans to purchase 75 acres to build a 3,000-foot turf airstrip with a slightly shorter crosswind runway.</p>



<p>“He said that his membership and belief in the RAF closed the deal on his decision,” Myrick said.</p>



<p>One of his primary goals is to provide camping and recreation opportunities. The property is centrally located in the state for fly-ins with two airports with services 25-30 miles nearby.</p>



<p>The two discussed RUS protections, logistical issues, and private property rights in Arkansas. Ellison is considering registering with the FAA to be included on charts for better exposure.</p>



<p>“I always believed that the RUS amendments are the first step in a much larger long term plan. Stories like this reinforce our belief that it is all worth the work and effort,” Myrick said.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The airstrip at Grand Gulch, AZ, near the north rim of the Grand Canyon was the scene of a work party Mar. 16 headed up by Recreational Aviation Foundation southern&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">Utah Liaison Wayne Loeber</a>. Thanks to last year’s efforts by the RAF to commit to a maintenance agreement with the BLM and National Park Service, access to this historic airstrip has been assured for years to come. The first all-volunteer work party took place last May, involving volunteers from the RAF,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.utahbackcountrypilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utah Backcountry Pilots</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/news/2013/azpilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona Pilots Assoc.</a>
</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grand_gulch_work_party_2.jpg">



<p>RAF&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">Utah Liaison Steve Durtschi</a>, RAF volunteers and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://old.theraf.org/news/2013/www.utahbackcountrypilots.org" target="_blank">Utah Backcountry Pilots</a>&nbsp;cooperated on this year’s project. Weather was ideal and a half dozen folks flew into the dirt strip, located just under 50 miles southwest of St. George; others endured primitive canyon country roads to arrive there. The help came from around Utah and New Mexico; a Cessna 206 from near Hurricane, UT landed, bringing two pilot friends from Alaska.</p>



<p>Volunteers were greeted by Matthew Hintzman from Grand Canyon-Parashant Nat’l Monument.</p>



<p>Teams worked both runways, using hand tools to improve the approx. 2,500 ft N/S and mechanically dragging the E/W runway.</p>



<p>“The north-south is in reasonable shape and east-west is okay for backcountry aircraft and will improve as we get more rock thrown off,” said Gordon Rock, RAF volunteer who flies out of the Seattle area and St. George, UT.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The 89<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;General Assembly of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1020.pdf" target="_blank">Arkansas passed House Bill 1020</a>&nbsp;on February 7, essentially protecting private airstrip owners throughout Arkansas from litigation from non-commercial aviation activity on their land.&nbsp; The bill added “aviation” to the other recreational activities listed in the state’s existing Recreational Use Statute. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Joe Jett (D) of&nbsp; Clay County and included 17 cosponsors. HB1020 passed both state houses with overwhelming support for what many of the Legislators called a “common sense statute.” Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe signed the bill on Monday, February 11.</p>



<p>Spearheading the bill through the process were Yasmina Platt of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association&nbsp;<a href="http://aopa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(AOPA)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">David Myrick, Arkansas Liaison</a>&nbsp;for the RAF.</p>



<p>Actual text of the amendment reads, “to extend the limitation of liability for permitting the recreational use of land to a landowner who permits the free use of the landowner’s property for flying and landing aircraft.”</p>



<p>Myrick said, “this amendment will encourage the 200 owners of Arkansas’ private airstrips to more readily allow aviation activity on their airstrips, encouraging more people to enjoy all the recreational and tourism activities that Arkansas has to offer.”</p>



<p>With the passage of this bill, Arkansas joins&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/news/2010/update-state-recreational-use-statutes-they-pertain-aviation">16 other states</a>&nbsp;that have added aviation to their laws covering liability for certain recreational use.</p>



<p>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">John McKenna, president of the RAF</a>&nbsp;added, “we’re pleased with the success of this amendment. It&nbsp; protects landowners and preserves low-impact access by air – ideally near camping and scenic and recreational destinations.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.nmpilots.org/" target="_blank">New Mexico Pilot Association</a>&nbsp;held its third annual Negrito Fly-In Oct. 5-7, 2012.&nbsp; This year’s event marked the first year that NMP partnered with the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.azpilots.org/" target="_blank">Arizona Pilots Association</a>&nbsp;to host the event.&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/negrito_878921066.png">


<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/0NM7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Negrito Airstrip (0NM7)</a>&nbsp;is situated at 8,100 feet in southwestern New Mexico’s remote and beautiful Gila National Forest. Most mornings we were serenaded by bugling elk and howling coyotes. The fall colors were in full bloom on the ridges surrounding the airstrip.&nbsp; Located approximately 20 miles east of Reserve, New Mexico, 0NM7 is serene and infrequently visited.&nbsp; Comprised of a 7,500-foot m m&nbsp; m ain strip and a 4,000-foot crosswind strip, Negrito is on forest service land and is in tremendous shape — such good shape that a Bonanza and Cardinal were able to easily land and take off from the strip.</p>



<p>During the course of the three days, 26 aircraft and approximately 40 people attended.&nbsp; We feasted on chili brats, blueberry pancakes and steaks. On Saturday morning, a group of us flew over to the newly opened Double Circle&nbsp;Ranch (0AZ8) in Arizona to join its opening celebration.&nbsp; Aircraft also visited other Forest Service strips located in the GNF. Later that evening we gathered around the campfire to tell hangar stories and listen to Clayton Stansel and his band play their version of country western music.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good company, beautiful surroundings and great flying experiences marked another successful fly-in weekend. We hope that those of you who couldn’t make it this year can make it to next year’s event. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sullivan Lake is a very special place with so much to do after you fly there.&nbsp; It is a great place to bring the whole family.

<![CDATA[<p>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">RAF President John McKenna</a>&nbsp;attended a planning meeting regarding a potentially new airstrip in an area of Minnesota known as the North West Angle, or as the locals refer to it as “The Angle.” The meeting, organized by James Hanson of Albert, Lea, Minnesota, was held Monday August 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://ci.baudette.mn.us/" target="_blank">Baudette, Minnesota</a>, which is the county seat to the area that includes The Angle. Hanson has been tireless in his effort to establish an operating airstrip in the area, as well as a long-time fan of the area. &nbsp;Also in attendance on behalf of the RAF was Kirk Hiner of Kenyon, Minnesota.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NW-Angle-MN.jpg">



<p>The Recreational Aviation Foundation is interested in this due to the extensive recreational opportunities that exist in this part of the country. The North West Angle area is the walleye capital of the world and this particular location is not only unique due to its beauty, but is also remote in the sense that it is the farthest point north in the United States. To get to this remote part of the world, one can either travel by boat for nearly 2 hours, drive a gravel road for 3 hours, or fly for about 25-30 minutes. Thus, the attraction to having an available airport in the area is obvious.</p>



<p>Due to the recent passage of the amended&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/news/2010/update-state-recreational-use-statutes-they-pertain-aviation">Recreational Use Statutes (RUS)</a>&nbsp;in Minnesota during the last session, there is renewed interest in the possibility of opening a facility in this area. The Aug. 6 meeting that included the county commission, the state of Minnesota aeronautics department (MNDOT), and other interested parties, including the Lake of the Woods tourism council, lodge owners and others was a positive sign that aviation is alive and well in the state.</p>



<p>McKenna said, “I was encouraged by the MNDOT effort and their complete willingness to assist in any way that they could.” In addition it was discussed that the area offered a great place for float plane activity and the ability to re-establish that activity in this area would be a good thing.</p>



<p>There are now formalities that will need to be addressed such as feasibility studies, zoning, cost and who will be involved. However, for the time being it is positive that this project is moving forward.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Sixty-six years of separation evaporated when Ben Ryan climbed the ladder of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://p38assn.org/glacier-girl.htm" target="_blank">P-38,&nbsp;<em>Glacier Girl,&nbsp;</em>
</a>at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.airventure.org/" target="_blank">Oshkosh</a>&nbsp;2012 — it was 1946 when Ben last flew a P-38 in the final days of World War II. In fact, on Columbus Day in 1945, Ben was overrun by his wingman, a fellow aviator in another P-38 in trail. The damage done by that friendly midair bump chewed the tail off Ben’s aircraft, forcing him to bail out over the waters of the Panama Canal Zone. When asked at Oshkosh about the difficulty of bailing out of a P-38 due to the twin tail configuration, Ben had two comments: 1) Glad nobody told me that before I bailed out; and 2) Maybe it was because my wingman had already chewed the tail off that not only created the need to jump, but also created the lack of something to run into when bailing out.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/glacier_girl1.jpg">



<p>Sixty-six years to the date after his initial flight training at General Mitchell Field, just 90 miles away, Ben Ryan once again got into the cockpit. It was a day he had dreamed about for a good long time and the ability to once again get into the cockpit of the plane that he so dearly loved came about as a result of the generosity of some fine folks. The trip had been organized by the Recreational Aviation Foundation in order to say “thank you” for the&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/planned-giving">contribution</a>&nbsp;of the Ryan’s home, property and&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/ryan-field-pilot-info">airstrip</a>&nbsp;in northwest Montana to the RAF. Mr. and Mrs. Ryan are particularly proud of their service to their county and the ability to get back in a P-38 was something that was significant to all concerned.</p>



<p>Upon arrival at Oshkosh, it was Bob Cardin, one of the folks behind the recovery and restoration of the&nbsp;<em>Glacier Girl,</em>&nbsp;who made Ben’s return to the cockpit possible. Following the reunion, Bob commented that he was once again reminded that gentlemen like Ben were the real owners of this aircraft and he merely has the pleasure of being its present-day caretaker. Watching this nearly 90-year-old gentleman scamper up the ladder to the top of the wing, slide open the canopy and step into the cockpit as if the last time had been only &nbsp;yesterday, made time stand still. As he sat down in the cockpit, one could see the flood of memories that filled his face. For those of us that witnessed the event, there was barely a dry eye on the tarmac.</p>



<p>That moment in time could not have been possible without the generous support of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.signatureflight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Signature Flight Support</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.glacierjetcenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glacier Jet Center</a>&nbsp;of Kalispell, Montana. Both recognized the significance of the event and contributed to making the trip happen. We thank them for that.</p>



<p>To the Ryans, thank you on behalf of the Recreational Aviation Foundation as well as all those that appreciate and cherish the ability to fly.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Located roughly forty miles west of the Tuweep airstrip in northern Arizona is the historical Grand Gulch Mine.&nbsp; History has this as the first copper mine in Arizona, and you can admire the last remaining earthen smelter&nbsp;in the country amongst the ruins of this wonderful site. Taking the cue from aviation historian, and APA member, Arv Shultz, the RAF team went to work on securing the nearby airstrip, located on BLM land in the Grand Canyon – Parashant National Momument area.&nbsp; </p>



<p>This airstrip had been slowly degrading over the years of little use. When I shared this little gem with RAF supporter, Gordon Rock, he jumped to action from his home in St George Utah, first visiting and analyzing the site, and then meeting with the BLM leadership in St George. A follow up visit was them made, along with RAF&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">President John McKenna</a>. With everyone in agreement, John and RAF supporter Gordon Rock, began negotiations with the park service&nbsp;on a volunteer maintenance agreement that would ensure access and use to this site for years to come. The agreement was signed between the RAF and the Park Service on Monday&nbsp;<sup>April&nbsp;</sup>30th, and the first all-volunteer maintenance day took place on May&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;with 13 hard working volunteers including, members of<a href="http://utahbackcountrypilots.org/">&nbsp;Utah Backcountry Pilots</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://azpilots.org/">Arizona Pilots Assoc</a>&nbsp;and the RAF. </p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Grand-Gulch-Mine-05-15-12-2-e1562162243771-1024x578.jpg">



<p>The strip was dragged and garbage cleared.&nbsp;There wasn’t enough time to get the word out across the state on this work day, but stay tuned for another day to be announced this fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Important Notice:&nbsp; The airstrip is now mostly free of brush and growth; however it has loose stones and soft spots. Until further work is accomplished this fall it is recommended that this strip be used by Super Cub, 180/185 type aircraft or large bushwheel aircraft.&nbsp; Stay tuned for updates.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>The Minam River Lodge (Minam Lodge sits deep inside the Eagle Cap Wilderness Area.  Use at your discretion), airlift was an outstanding success, with 25-plus volunteers in 20-plus planes flying multiple sorties between Joseph, Oregon, and the lodge, on April 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>. The volunteer crews ferried new supplies in and roughly 50 years of accumulated debris out. The effort was a mutual gain: Pilots based out of Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California got a chance to visit the wilderness and help out the new owners and hands working to clean up the lodge and in exchange everyone will have cleaner and better facilities to enjoy for future recreational flying.<br>
<br>“This whole thing came about when RAF contacted the new owner, Barnes Ellis, last fall to request that the lodge and airstrip remain open to private pilots and at the same time asked if there was anything it could do to help,” said John McKenna, RAF president. “The concept of the airlift was born through the RAF, with the assistance of BackcountryPilots.org, Oregon Pilots Association and Idaho Aviation Association got word spread and pilots answered the call.”</p>



<p>Weather conditions were acceptable with winds increasing in the&nbsp;afternoon. Before operations ceased, the majority of trash had been removed and&nbsp;new mattresses, food and supplies delivered. “It was great to see so&nbsp;many pilots pulling together to keep access to places like Minam,” said Mike&nbsp;Hart, RAF Idaho liaison. “When you fall in love with a place like this, you do what you can to keep it open. RAF and other pilot groups are really about putting the&nbsp;spirit of cooperation to good use.”</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cessna206_Barb_Gonzalez-1024x842.jpg">


<p>The volunteer work crew spent the night and had a chance for a little rest and mostly to reflect on the days accomplishments.&nbsp; New friends were made and great stories told.</p>



<p>RAF would like to extend a big thank you to Bill Ables for his tireless effort and incredible competence in organizing the event and keeping it safe. Thanks also goes to the lodge owners and ground crews, especially crew chief and load master Aaron Gilles. And last but not least, a big shout out to all of the pilots involved in the airlift and all of the organizations that helped get the word out. It was an incredible success.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Bozeman, Mont. — The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) and BackcountryPilot.org (BCP), under guidance of the National Park Service (NPS), have combined efforts to successfully reopen the legendary “Chicken Strip.”&nbsp;</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rick-and-Tim-on-Chicken-Strip-2-1024x768.jpeg">The Chicken Strip has been unusable since August 7, 2011.



<p>Thanks to a group of hard-working volunteers, the Chicken Strip, closed by the NPS in August, due to safety concerns, reopened on October 15. Following weeks of discussion and negotiation, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between the NPS and the RAF enabled the NPS authorization of an RAF work party to repair and reopen the strip.</p>



<p>For many years pilots have enjoyed this unique “oasis” destination that services the remote Saline Warm Springs in Death Valley National Park. The recreational airstrip adjoins popular hot springs pools and camping areas and is also a crucial access point; the only other access to Saline Warm Springs is via a rough, 40-mile dirt road that takes three to four hours to navigate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The August closure was brought to the RAF’s attention by concerned participants on a&nbsp;popular aviation web site. John Kounis, the RAF Southern California Liaison, worked with the NPS to determine requirements for reopening the airstrip. &nbsp;From there, RAF volunteer and Kern Valley airport manager Rick Lach, took the lead, organizing volunteers to clear debris, mark the runway edges, and drag the strip. After the work was completed, all pilots agreed that the Chicken Strip is now in better shape than they had ever seen before.&nbsp;</p>

</a>
</p>



<p>Dedicated volunteers restored the surface to a condition better than it has ever been.</p>



<p>The RAF thanks the NPS and everyone else who worked diligently to find a workable resolution to the airstrip’s closure. Special thanks go out to the many volunteers who showed up, went to work and made it happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF is a 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to keeping the legacy of recreational aviation strong by preserving, maintaining and creating public use recreational and backcountry airstrips nationwide. To find out more about the RAF and support its work with a tax-deductible contribution, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theraf.org/">www.theraf.org</a>&nbsp;or call (406) 582-1723.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Fort Kent Airfield Re-Opens&nbsp;September 19, 2011</p>



<p>The RAF has been informed by the Fish River Flying Club that Fort Kent Airport is now available for aircraft operations.  The 2200 foot grass airstrip in the very northern portion of Maine is restricted use rather than public use, so a call to Mr. Tom Voisine at 207-834-5685 should be made for a safety briefing, as well as airfield information and conditions.  Though on the chart the airport will be designated as restricted use, the public will be welcome to use it once they have requested and received a safety briefing.   Camping will be allowed, and the Fish River is only a short walk from the airfield.  The RAF is proud to have assisted the Fish River Flying Club, and we congratulate their success in providing recreational aviators with another destination.</p>

<p>What could be better than the option to land “wet” or “dry”?&nbsp; The weekend of August 19th, at Sullivan Lake, WA (09S), just south of the Canadian border, gave pilots that option.&nbsp; Some came on floats, some on wheels.&nbsp; Few sites offer the opportunity to land on either – Sullivan Lake is one of those places.&nbsp; Over 25 airplanes landed at Sullivan Lake, for the weekend.&nbsp; And that’s not all.&nbsp; The 8.5 mile hike around the lake followed by a turn on the rope swing terminating in a refreshing swim is a must.&nbsp; Mountain biking, fishing, working on the airstrip or just sitting relaxing in your lawn chair watching planes come and go provided something for everyone!&nbsp; And to top it off&nbsp;<a href="http://wa-spa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Corrado from WA Seaplanes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">Bob Kay RAF WA State Liaison</a>&nbsp;cooked steaks, corn on the cob, and camp beans for everyone on Sat. night.&nbsp; There were salads and desserts with an exchange of good recipes and plenty to eat.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sullivan-Lake-2014-5-1024x683.jpg">



<p>It was nice to visit with Paul Wolfe, the WA DOT manager of this airport and 15 other WA State supported airports, some on private land, some on BLM and USFS land, and some on city municipal land.&nbsp; Paul realizes how important these airstrips are, and what needs to be done to keep them open; and hopefully build more.&nbsp; Bob Kay has done a great job of building that relationship with Paul.</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the event we look forward to the next time we get together.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>GREAT FALLS, MT – August 9, 2011– Last week, a Federal Judge ruled in favor of both the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) in response to a 2009 lawsuit brought against the agency by the Montana Wilderness Society and Western Watersheds Project.</p>



<p>The RAF, with support from the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://montanapilots.org/" target="_blank">Montana Pilots Association (MPA)</a>, joined with the BLM in defense of this suit because six permitted airstrips within the monument would have been reconsidered for possible closure. The suit against the BLM would have invalidated a large portion of the recently developed Resource Management Plan (RMP).&nbsp; This action would have caused the extensive planning process to start over and placed six backcountry airstrips in jeopardy.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sOeE74U2R6aYuibQAHgJag_thumb_34c-1024x731.jpg">Missouri Breaks



<p>The judge stated in his ruling that the BLM spent several years developing the RMP with a wide array of public input. The BLM was tasked with forming a plan that would balance public access while protecting the Monument as a natural resource. Specifically referring to the airstrips within the Monument, the judge ruled that the BLM took a “middle ground” by only approving six of the then existing ten airstrips and imposing a seasonal closure on one of the six.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The RAF and the Montana Pilots Association (MPA) actively participated in the six-year Monument RMP planning process by attending numerous public meetings and providing policy makers with factual aviation information. “This was a very important case to the RAF and its members,” said&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">RAF President John McKenna</a>.&nbsp; “In keeping with our mission of preserving public use recreational and backcountry airstrips, we are naturally pleased with this ruling.&nbsp; We look forward to continued work with the BLM to keep and preserve other airstrips around the nation. ”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The RAF and MPA interests were represented by Paul Turcke, who successfully moved for judgment, filed supporting papers, and argued at the hearing, which was attended by&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">RAF Directors Chuck Jarecki and Dan Prill</a>. &nbsp;According to Mr. Turcke, “Today, we saw the legal process work. &nbsp;BLM’s decision is perfect for none, but reflects a thorough and valid process. ” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF will continue monitoring this issue to ensure that aviation interests are properly represented in future action involving the Monument airstrips. McKenna further commented, “These airstrips provide low impact entry to the Monument and critical search and rescue access as well.&nbsp; Working to preserve their use is part of the RAF mission.”</p>

<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2007-Timeline-Russian-Flats-Maybe.jpg">



<p>RAF volunteers from Montana, New Mexico, Idaho, and Washington spent much of the day clearing brush and rocks from the campground area, felling some dead trees, and bucking them up into firewood.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shadows lengthened, we all enjoyed a taste of the Recreation that is the reason the airstrip exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;With tents pitched and planes tied down, burgers and brats cooked over the fire, and stories got taller.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother Nature kicked up her heels just a little, with a rumble of thunder, a few flashes of lightning, and a splash of rain and small hail, but no harm was done, and the clouds were gone as quickly as they had formed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon dark moved in, stars came out, and Larry Larson treated us to some campfire music, Montana-style.</p>



<p>Already looking forward to next time…Mike Todd, Yelm, WA</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The “Chicken Strip” at Saline Valley in Death Valley National Park, which was recently closed for safety reasons, should reopen soon due to quick action by the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) with the full support of National Park Service (NPS) managers. Death Valley Chief Ranger Brent Pennington reported that a local volunteer, Lizard Lee, had closed the runway by placing large Xs with white painted rocks subsequent to heavy rains and flash flooding from strong thunderstorms.</p>



<p>Within 24 hours of learning of the closure of the Chicken Strip, the RAF sent their Southern California Liaison, John Kounis, to ascertain the extent of the flood damage and meet with Ranger Pennington. The use of a private aircraft was crucial for this assessment, since NPS personnel have not yet been able to visit the Chicken Strip due to washouts of the access road.</p>



<p>John Kounis provided the RAF and NPS photographs of the airstrip that revealed only minimal damage that could be repaired with a work party employing a small number of volunteers. After receiving the RAF photographs, Death Valley National Park Superintendent Sarah Craighead and Chief Ranger Pennington reaffirmed their commitment to reopen the airstrip as soon as possible. Other NPS personnel involved in the decision were National Aviation Specialist Jim Traub and Regional Aviation Specialist Shad Sitz, both of whom are pilots who have previously used the Chicken Strip and advocate its continued operation.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chicken_strip_main.jpg">



<p>The Chicken Strip is within walking distance of several natural hot springs with impressive views.</p>



<p>The NPS has few resources to reopen the Chicken Strip due to limited staff and the remote location (Death Valley National Park does not operate any aircraft, so a trip to the Chicken Strip is currently 1 1/2-day trek requiring an overnight stay in the desert). Fortunately, maintenance of the strip falls under a landmark memorandum of understanding between the National Park Service and the Recreational Aviation Foundation.</p>



<p>Superintendent Craighead has one legal concern regarding NPS exposure to liability of volunteer workers. As soon as NPS legal personnel address that concern, the RAF can schedule a work party to reopen the airstrip. Check back on the RAF website for further updates,&nbsp;<a href="http://theraf.org/">http://theraf.org</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In&nbsp;<a href="http://fortkent.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fort Kent, Maine</a>&nbsp;a small group of pilots has contacted the town requesting that they be allowed to re-open the local municipal airport near the Fish River.&nbsp; They formed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fiddleheadfocus.com/story/new-flying-club-forms-locally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fish River Flying Club</a>&nbsp;and have now signed a lease agreement with the town to repair, maintain and operate the 3,200 foot grass runway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">John Nadeau</a>&nbsp;of the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) contacted Mr. Tommy Voisine of the Flying Club and learned that the Town Council of Fort Kent seemed to be in favor of the agreement, but they were concerned about liability.&nbsp; Nadeau explained that Maine now has aviation included in the Recreational Use Statute, and that if the Town was not concerned about other recreational activities on the land, then noncommercial aviation activities should be seen no differently than those other activities, such as hunting or snowmobiling.&nbsp; Mr. Voisne took this information to the Town Council and they agreed.&nbsp; The Town attorney drew up a five year lease for the Fish River Flying Club which was signed on July 8, 2011.</p>



<p>Mr. Voisine is careful to explain that the airport, closed since the 1980’s, is not yet opened. &nbsp;&nbsp;It will require some smoothing and the addition of some gravel to fill some ruts made by trucks over the years.&nbsp; The Flying Club is in the process of obtaining services and funding for the needed work.&nbsp; Mr. Voisine has been in contact with the FAA and will complete the licensing procedure only when the repair work is finished to assure operational safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The RAF has made a donation to help with the repairs and encourages others to do so.&nbsp; Donations can be sent to Fish River Flying Club, c/o Tommy Voisine, 242 Market Street, Fort Kent, Maine 04743.</p>



<p>Nadeau said, “Helping the Fish River Flying Club at Fort Kent perfectly fits the RAF Mission of‘Keeping the legacy of recreational aviation strong by preserving, maintaining, and creating public use recreational and backcountry airstrips nationwide<em>.”</em>
</p>



<p>Watch for information regarding the opening of Fort Kent Airport on this web site. &nbsp;Mr. Voisine stated that the airport will be licensed as restricted use rather than public use, and that he should be called for a safety briefing and airfield information and conditions at 207-834-5685.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Voisine also indicated that, though on the chart the airport will be designated as restricted use, the public will be welcome to use it once they have requested and received a safety briefing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Camping will be allowed, and the Fish River is only a short walk from the airfield.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donations to support the RAF Mission can be mailed to RAF, 1711 West College, Bozeman, MT 59715 or <a href="http://old.theraf.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=2">click here to donate now.</a>

<![CDATA[<p>On July 7, 2011 Pennsylvania became the ninth state to include aviation in its Recreational Use Statute (RUS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2011&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0870&amp;pn=0908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 870</a>&nbsp;was sponsored by Representative Garth Everett and strongly supported by Representative Tina Pickett along with twenty two other co-sponsors, and was approved last week by Governor Tom Corbett.&nbsp; &nbsp;HB 870 added the words “recreational noncommercial aircraft operations or recreational noncommercial ultra-light operations on private airstrips” to the list of other activities in the law that define “recreational purpose. ”</p>



<p>Recreational Use Statutes provide landowners a degree of liability protection when others are using their land for recreational purposes.&nbsp; Due to the regulatory nature of aviation, private airstrip owners have not been certain that they are provided with the same protections afforded by this statute for aviation activities as they are for such activities as hunting, pleasure driving, etc.&nbsp; Passage of HB 870 clarifies the statute to include noncommercial aviation.</p>



<p>Pilots will still need to request permission of the airstrip owner before operating aircraft on private airstrips.&nbsp; But with this new language in the state RUS Pennsylvania’s private airstrip owners are more likely to allow public access for noncommercial aircraft operations.</p>



<p>Credit for getting this accomplished for Pennsylvania airstrip owners and pilots goes to George Jenkins and his local Representative, Tina Pickett.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Jenkins had worked for several years to get legislation introduced.&nbsp; After learning of the RAF effort to pass RUS legislation in New York, Mr. Jenkins contacted the RAF and requested information from other states that have included aviation in their RUS.&nbsp; That information was forwarded to the PA legislators.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The New Mexico Pilots Association Recreational Airstrip Committee (NM-RAC) has organized a work party for April 29 through May 1, 2011 at the Negrito Airstrip (0NM7) in South West New Mexico.&nbsp; A rain date is set for the following weekend.&nbsp; The Negrito Airstrip is located at N33° 31.253667′ W108° 32.570200′ (estimated by&nbsp;<a href="http://airnav.com/airport/0nm7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AirNav</a>).&nbsp; Its elevation is 8,143 ft and it hosts two runways.&nbsp; The main runway (17/35) is 7,500 ft long and 60 ft. wide.&nbsp; The secondary runway (3/21) is 4,000 ft long and 60 ft wide (all information from&nbsp;<a href="http://airnav.com/airport/0nm7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AirNav</a>).&nbsp; The airstrip is located 18 miles SE of Reserve, NM.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nmpilots.org/rac_overview.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NM-RAC</a>&nbsp;organized a fly-in there last fall and representatives have been talking to Bob Madil, the local US Forest Service District Ranger, about enhancing the airstrip.&nbsp; The work party will remove rocks from the sides of the runway to improve the parking along the airstrip.&nbsp; Larry Filener, Chairman of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nmpilots.org/rac_overview.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NM-RAC</a>, warns pilots flying in to stop their aircraft on the runway and walk the area they want to park before moving their plane into parking.&nbsp; Many of the rocks are big enough to catch a prop, and they are usually hidden in the grass.&nbsp; The New Mexico Pilots Association and the RAF are very excited to announce their growing partnership with the National Forest Service in an effort to insure the future of the airstrip and its maintenance.</p>



<p>Negrito airstrip is managed by the United States Forest Service as a fire base and prior permission is required for use.&nbsp; Pilots should make arrangements to attend the work party by contacting Larry Filener through the New Mexico Pilot Association (NMPA) website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nmpilots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://nmpilots.org</a>.&nbsp; He will provide briefing information including frequencies and will add pilots’ names to the work party list.</p>



<p>The airstrip is located in the beautiful&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/gila" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gila National Forest</a>.&nbsp; There are no amenities at this time but the NM-RAC is working to establish permanent facilities at the airstrip.&nbsp; In addition to the work contemplated for this year, NMPA has requested that the Forest Service allow them to begin planning for installation of a latrine, shelter and picnic tables.&nbsp; Both NMPA and RAF are very excited at this development as it will further our vision of having Negrito become one of the Nation’s premier backcountry airstrips. The president of the Recreational Aviation Foundation,&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">John McKenna</a>, says “The airstrip is a great asset for the State of New Mexico and it is great to see it being preserved.&nbsp; The New Mexico pilots are working to fulfill the RAF mission of&nbsp;<strong>“Keeping the legacy of recreational aviation strong by preserving, maintaining and creating public use recreational and backcountry airstrips nationwide.”</strong>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">Rol Morrow</a>, RAF Director and New Mexico State Liaison says, “I am very excited about the progress the NM-RAC has made with the US Forest Service in the preservation of the backcountry airstrips in New Mexico.”</p>



<p>The NM-RAC is working on other airstrips also so stay tuned to learn more.  You can also learn more about the New Mexico Pilots Association and the <a href="http://old.theraf.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&amp;id=8">Negrito Airstrip Fly-In</a> by visiting their website at http://nmpilots.org.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the hard work of RAF Member Ron Krohn, and support from many others, the Governor of New Mexico signed into law House Bill 12 on April 6th.&nbsp; This law adds “operation of aircraft” to the state’s existing Recreational Use Statute. “This is a great step for the recreational pilots, the backcountry, and of course, the state of New Mexico” said New Mexico Pilot Association (NMPA) President Joyce Woods.</p>



<p>NMPA and RAF member Dave Hamann provided essential legislative contacts to this process.</p>



<p>In announcing the news, Ron said, “I am very pleased to report that Governor Susana Martinez has signed the bill into law!&nbsp; I would like to especially thank Rep. Jim Trujillo (D) and Rep. Jim White (R) who supported this legislation throughout the process.&nbsp; These efforts, combined with the support and assistance of the RAF, and the individual NMPA members who reached out to their respective legislators, was instrumental in moving this project to a successful completion.”</p>

<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">RAF Director and&nbsp;</a>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">New Mexico RAF Liaison&nbsp;</a>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">Rol</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/state-liaisons">Murrow</a>&nbsp;noted, “Ron has worked this issue for the last two years, entirely as a volunteer.&nbsp; This was his first time dealing with the legislative process, and he was concerned that he did not know enough about it.&nbsp; Ron stands as an example of what can happen when a dedicated volunteer decides something needs to be done – and does it.”</p>



<p>The new law is likely to lead to the opening of a large number of small airstrips located in beautiful areas of the mountains and deserts of New Mexico. The volunteers of the NMPA Recreational Airstrip Committee have begun mapping airstrips in the state and will be adding them to the NMPA website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nmpilots.org/">www.nmpilots.org</a>&nbsp;as the information is verified.</p>



<p>
<a href="http://old.theraf.org/content/directors">RAF President John McKenna</a>&nbsp;stated “What a great day for New Mexico and all of aviation. &nbsp;Surely this will lead to the opening of new airstrips in New Mexico as well as showing others across the country that this can be done.&nbsp; The RAF is pleased to be a part of opening new airstrips, as opposed to watching closures.”</p>

<a href="http://www.centurycompaniesinc.com/site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Century Companies</a>&nbsp;of Lewistown, Montana was awarded the Gold Pulaski by the Recreational Aviation Foundation at the Montana Aviation Conference held recently in Helena, Montana.</p>



<p>The Gold Pulaski is the highest award given by the RAF. It signifies an outstanding contribution by a company or individual for work on the RAF mission. Century Companies under, the direction of President Tim Robertson, contributed thousands of dollars, equipment use, and countless hours of volunteer labor to build the Russian Flat airstrip in central Montana. Russian Flat is the first new airstrip built on United States Forest Service land in over 45 years.</p>



<p>The new airstrip is complete with camping facilities, handicap accessible toilet, aircraft corral (to keep stray critters away from your plane) and a new grass airstrip in a gorgeous setting suitable for use by most all aircraft.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Russian-Flat-Airstrip-Opening-2010-029.jpg">



<p>In his remarks during the presentation, RAF President John McKenna had this to say about Century, “This is a contribution to aviation that is not only significant, but will last”</p>



<p>Jeff Patnode, who is in Sr. Management with Century, accepted the award.&nbsp; In addition he provided personal hands on volunteer labor to the project.&nbsp; Jeff flies a Cessna 185, and in his remarks upon acceptance only had this to say. “If you have never been involved in building an airstrip, I will tell you it’s pretty cool.&nbsp; So, let’s all go build another one”</p>



<p>The RAF is proud of its relationship with Century as well as all the people affiliated with the Russian Flat project.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Following years of work and discussions, on July 2 Abigail Kimbell, Chief of the U. S. Forest Service, signed a directive acknowledging the long and proud history of aviation use and airstrips on forest service lands, and asked USFS managers at all levels to inventory and maintain existing facilities, and to support aviation as an important recreational activity. This action resulted from meetings between representatives of the Recreational Aviation Foundation and a team of senior Forest Service executives in Washington. Similar to policy statements regarding many other classes of the public and user groups such as hikers, fishermen, and boaters, the memorandum says: “Aviation has been part of our country’s heritage, both as a mode of transportation and as a means of access to remote and scenic areas for a wide variety of purposes. Backcountry airstrips are an appropriate use of National Forest System (NFS) lands as they provide enhanced access for a variety of legitimate recreational activities… Recreational aircraft and backcountry airstrips can be an integral part of a balanced and efficient transportation system.”</p>



<p>From the earliest days of aviation a system of backcountry airstrips has served the forest service and its users, providing support for forest managers, fire crews, and medical evacuation aircraft. And countless backpackers, campers, boaters, and fishermen have used them to gain access to remote parts of the forest.</p>



<p>Unlike other recreational facilities requiring hundreds of miles of roadways, airstrips require minimal disturbance of the natural landscape, while serving as internal trailheads for remote areas. Airplanes do not have driven wheels so they do not churn up fragile landscapes the way other vehicles do. They are&lt; considered a low-impact use.</p>



<p>In addition the document notes the importance of existing and future mutually beneficial relationships with aviation groups, similar to those with other groups. It says “Operation and maintenance of airstrips may provide opportunities for cooperative relationships under Challenge-Cost Share and other authorities. The recreation pilot communities are significantly engaged in providing funding, human resources, expertise, and equipment for backcountry airstrips on NFS lands. … The use of volunteers in joint development of Russian Flat public airstrip on the Judith Ranger District, Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana is an excellent example of cooperative development.”</p>



<p>John McKenna, President of the Recreation Aviation Foundation, notes: “After many years of discussion we here at the RAF are very pleased to have a good working relationship with the USFS. The USFS has worked hard to better understand the desires and uses of the aviation community, and this document communicates that understanding. We look forward to building on the partnership and the trust this document brings forth.” The Recreational Aviation Foundation, devoted to the perpetuation and improvement of recreational aviation opportunities on both public and private lands, congratulated the Forest Service for its recognition of aviation’s importance, and also acknowledged the contributions of dozens of state, local, and other aviation groups in building and maintaining strong relationships with land management agencies, creating the foundation for a strong system of backcountry airstrips.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Four years spent cooperating with the US Forest Service, planning, building trust and credibility has resulted in a new site for a recreational airstrip in the beautiful Russian Flat of central Montana, a short walk from the south fork of the Judith River where anglers enjoy catch-and-release fishing.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Russian-flat.jpg">


<p>Dan Prill of Sand Coulee, Montana, took the lead for the non-profit Recreational Aviation Foundation throughout the comprehensive planning process, which included the requisite public comment input, an EIS, and public appeals period. The US Forest Service, responding to the wide-ranging concerns of the public, has authorized the establishment of the airstrip at Russian Flat in their Record of Decision.</p>



<p>The site, located about 40 sm southwest of Lewistown, Montana, was selected by the Forest Service because it met environmental, wildlife and aesthetic criteria with minimum disturbance to the landscape. It is ideal for recreational purposes, because it is adjacent to an established campground with picnic tables, a vault toilet and an existing unpaved road. The concept is to prepare a 4,000-foot long grass strip in the 6,300-foot elevation meadow: Lat N46 deg 43′ 18″; Lon W110 deg. 24′ 26″. Prill commented, “this decision is significant because until this location was selected at Russian Flat, there were no public airstrips on Forest Service lands east of the Rocky Mountain Front.” The RAF has approved an $8,000 grant to be awarded to the Montana Pilots Association’s Recreational Airstrip Committee for grounds preparation and rolling of the landing surface. To allow for adequate revegetation, it is anticipated that the public will not be allowed to use the strip for landing and takeoffs until Fall 2009.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RAF recently received a generous grant from the Wolf Aviation Fund supported by Alfred L. and Constance C. Wolf. The grant dollars have been used to fund the legal research on Recreational Use Statutes in all 50 states with the goal of creating a database and identifying their strengths and weaknesses so that the RAF may provide that data to private and public airstrip owners and others to encourage making airstrips available for public use, and to also identify where further action may be indicated to provide the most protection from liability.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Ben Ryan’s P-38 was out of control. The Lightning following him had just taken evasive action to avoid a collision and, in doing so, the other aircraft peeled the right-vertical stabilizer from Ben’s twin fighter. Ben was helpless; rudder and elevator, gone. His aircraft tucked into a steep dive and the roiling waters of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Panama filled his vision. Sliding the canopy back, he dropped clear and immediately deployed his chute. Seconds later, the P-38 disappeared, with nothing but a circle of foam remaining on the surface of the ocean below. After his own splashdown, a native brought him to shore. The very next day, Ben was back in the air.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ben-Ryan-7.png">Army Aviator Wings Pinning



<p>Six decades later Ben still loves aviation; and it is evident when you visit his home. The three airplanes that Ben built years ago sit in the hangar by his home, looking like they are ready to fly. Early in the 1970’s, Ben and his wife Agnes–affectionately known as “Butchie” from her maiden name Butchkosky–began construction of an airstrip on their property near Glacier National Park. To create their airstrip, Ben spent several summers filling a wide drainage between two level benches with only a small front-end loader on his tractor–the equivalent of filling a swimming pool with a teaspoon.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DSC_5605-e1560965002791.jpg">Ben and Butchie at Ryan Field



<p>
</p>



<p>Summers were spent creating the runway, and Ben’s winters were spent buying, building and restoring airplanes. In 1974, he began construction of his first plans-built airplane, a tandem seat Wendt Traveler. Three years later, it was complete and ready for its maiden flight. Ben was back in the air and loving every minute.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bestowing the Love of Flying</h3>



<p>Two years ago, the childless couple began to consider their legacy. How would the Ryan name continue? At the recommendation of a friend, they called to inquire about the recently formed Recreational Aviation Foundation; a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving recreational airstrips.</p>



<p>RAF Director, Chuck Jarecki, met with the Ryans to begin a dialog and to determine what their level of involvement might be. The Ryans fell in love with Chuck; and, likewise, he with them, establishing a positive relationship personally and with the RAF. Their desire was to leave a gift to the pilot community that would continue in perpetuity; to bring joy to others as it has brought joy to them and to help reverse the tendency for airstrips to disappear. They began to implement a plan to incrementally transfer ownership of the entire property to the RAF for the creation of a recreational pilot’s retreat with a public-use airstrip.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ryan-Field-Aerial-2-2020-3.jpg">The Ryan airstrip in the shadow of the Flathead Range near Columbia Falls, Montana. The timber thinning mentioned in the article can be seen on the left side of the airstrip.



<p>Ryan’s property adjacent to the airstrip was mostly covered with timber, creating a serious forest fire hazard. Ben requested the RAF to contract for and supervise a selective timber harvest to enhance the recreational aspects of the property and reduce the fire danger. The income from the logging operation was used to establish an account for perpetual maintenance of the airstrip. Situated at 3,600 feet on the west slope of the Flathead Range, the airstrip is kept mowed all summer and the windsock is changed when it becomes faded. However, Ben states, “this is still a ‘bush’ airstrip.” Tall trees occupy both ends and squirrelly winds can test any pilot’s flying skills. A steep, stabilized approach is required to set-down in the first third of the 2,500 ft. runway.</p>



<p>
</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Foundation Maximizes Benefits to Donors</h3>



<p>Because of the magnitude of this gift, the RAF formed an Auxiliary Foundation to maximize the tax benefit to the Ryans and future donors of properties or other significant endowments. Ryan Field is a treasure that we have the opportunity to enjoy for years to come and the Ryan legacy will continue through their generous donation. Words fail to express the gratitude each of us should have toward this lovely couple. It may also serve to create awareness of the capability of others of leaving a similar legacy.</p>



<p>While the airstrip is a gift to the flying public and backcountry aviation, the Ryans still make their quiet home there. They cherish your visit, but ask that you first make arrangements with the RAF so that they know when you’ll arrive. You are welcome, but the RAF asks that you respect their privacy. Due to the nature of the area, large fly-ins are not appropriate. Use common courtesy, and keep aircraft numbers at a minimum.</p>



<p>If you have the opportunity to visit, you can expect the Ryans to give you a tour. Ask Ben about his airplanes and you’ll be invited into his hangar. You’ll be captivated by the stories both of them have about their life together after meeting on a blind date during World War II. Butchie always enjoys fresh fruit or a box of chocolates. Tell them how much you appreciate their sacrifice for this country and for the flying public. One thing is certain; you won’t want to leave.</p>



<p>When the native brought Ben to shore after escaping his crippled airplane, the government offered a reward for saving a fallen airman–fifty dollars–a heck of an investment for putting this remarkable life back into commission. Perhaps, you too will consider a similar investment toward the future of backcountry aviation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If you’re interested in visiting:</h3>



<p>Please contact one of the Board Members of the RAF if you are considering visiting the Ryan Property. The Ryans still live on the property and ask that you call ahead to schedule your visit. Go to our&nbsp;<a href="http://old.theraf.org/contact-us">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;section. Any of the directors can make arrangements for you.</p>



<img src="https://theraf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ben-and-Butch-2011-1024x680.jpg">



<p>The Ryan’s were publicly thanked for their extraordinary donation and vision at the 2006 Montana Aviation Convention in Helena, Montana in March of 2006.</p>

<![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tuweep The Grand Canyon Secret</h3>



<p>Few things are more disappointing to pilots than an enormous white “X” marking the threshold of their favorite recreational airstrip. Such is now the case at Tuweep (L50) airstrip on the north rim of the Grand Canyon.</p>



<p>
<strong>Update:</strong> The RAF has been participating in the potential lease and reopening process of the Tuweep airstrip (near Grand Canyon) from the State of Arizona and stand ready to create a Tuweep Fund to receive tax deductible donations directed toward its future maintenance. See additional update from 17FEB06 at the bottom of this page.</p>



<p>Midway between the coniferous forests of the North Rim and the broiling canyon bottom, Tuweep lies at an elevation of 4600 feet on the western, red-sandstone shelf known as the Esplanade. This is high desert country with mild winters and light snows. Paiute for “barren valley,” the Toroweap valley offers a variety of plants including juniper, pinyon pine and, of course, sagebrush. Cacti and agave are more prevalent as you approach the canyon rim and during the wet years, wildflowers paint the ground and surrounding hillsides.<br>Wildlife is also abundant and the area offers some of the finest habitat in the nation for heavy antlered mule deer. Coyotes keep the jackrabbit population in check and the occasional rattlesnake adds excitement to day hikes.<br>The Toroweap Overlook of the Grand Canyon allows an experience vastly different than the south rim. Unfettered by guardrails, signs and crowded trails, there is nothing between you and a dramatic 3000 foot drop to the Colorado River below. The serpentine trail of green water is slowed by massive lava flows before it cascades over Lava Falls, the most famous rapids in the canyon. On a still day, the roar of the falls can be heard at the canyon rim.</p>



<p>Visiting Tuweep requires self-sufficiency and an adventuresome spirit. It’s just the type of remote destination recreational pilots look for.</p>



<p>Just a few years ago, nearly twenty airstrips dotted the landscape north of the Grand Canyon. They have been methodically plucked one by one from the charts and just a few remain today. The state of Arizona cites liability concerns and lack of pilot interest for these random closures. Tuweep is the most essential remaining public strip offering access to the unspoiled areas of this vast National Park.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Without History…We’re History</h3>



<p>On January 11, 2000, a gaggle of helicopters including Marine One and four Hueys descended on the Toroweap valley. President Clinton stepped forth and announced the formation of the new Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. In a symbolic gesture, wearing a brown suede jacket and cowboy boots, Mr. Clinton sat at the dusty airstrip and signed four Presidential Proclamations on the kitchen table of Tuweep Ranger Clair Roberts. The section of state school-trust land containing Tuweep airstrip is also encompassed within the new National Monument.<br>The purpose of the executive order was to prevent mining and future development and to preserve the rich history of the area. Mr. Clinton was acting under the Antiquities Act passed by congress in 1906 to protect “objects of historic and scientific interest.”<br>That history should certainly include the life of John Riffey.<br>For 38 years, Riffey served as the NPS Ranger at Tuweep. He and his beloved Super Cub “Pogo,” aptly named for the short hops it took, served the visitors of the Arizona Strip and the Park as only a pilot and his airplane could. Aviation was important to Riffey. Not only for the enjoyment he felt while flying, but also for the access it offered to remote areas of the Park.<br>Ironically, just yards away from the table where the president signed the executive order, lies the grave of John Riffey. His date of birth and date of death do not appear on the gravestone. When he lived wasn’t important to him; how he lived was. The stone bears the image of his trusted “Pogo” and his epitaph: “The man who could spend a lifetime on the rim and not waste a minute.” Nothing else was necessary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">There Is Still Hope</h3>



<p>Tuweep sees an average of three private aircraft landings per week during the busy season and has been used extensively by the Bureau of Land Management as a staging area during firefighting operations.<br>Mike Ebersole, former Tuweep Ranger, commercial pilot and airport manager for the Tuweep strip, contacted State Land Department Manager Chuck Hudson. When asked if it was too late to reverse the closure, Mr. Hudson stated that “they (the state) would not be averse to resurrecting the project and trying to keep the airstrip open.”<br>Although he was transferred to Sitka, Alaska in 2002, former Tuweep ranger Clair Roberts’ love for the Toroweap valley has never waned. Like Riffey, he also flew his own airplane out of Tuweep. Roberts believes the short-term solution to keep the strip open is by generating a grass-roots effort to mount a writing campaign on the state of Arizona and the FAA. He remains committed to spearheading this effort because he believes it is worth saving and that proper notice was not given to the public. Ultimately, a land swap may be the best long-term solution for keeping L50 open. Interest in the strip among pilots has always remained high and there has been no history of noise complaints. Encroachment into the Grand Canyon SFRA has been rare and largely unintentional.</p>



<p>Letters protesting the closure of Tuweep (L50) should be directed to the FAA and the Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano with carbon copies to ADOT Aeronautics Division (Ray Boucher) and Arizona State Land Department (Charles Hudson).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Update from our friends in the Utah Back Country Pilots’ Assoc. : 17FEB06</h3>



<p>This last month has been an exciting one in the quest to obtain the lease of the Tuweep airstrip. For a while it looked like we would not be able to get anyone to underwrite the required general liability policy of $5 mil. One of the people associated with the Recreational Aviation Foundation found us a supplier so now we have that. the next step was to get the State Land to work with us in minimizing our cost exposure and give us the property that we need to get to the edge of the section eliminating the need for a right of way and the costs associated with that and this has been accomplished as well now. Our next step is having a Cultural Resource survey done by a SHPO permitted contractor. I have selected one for this and that work shall start early February. I’m hoping to get the lease finalized by the end of Feb.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On another note………..</h3>



<p>Several APA members and back country activists have been attending this week’s public meetings in Kingman, Phoenix and Flagstaff regarding the BLM Draft Plan for the Arizona Strip. We have counted 21 strips up there and in the proposed plan only 8 are to be recognized and would remain. Tuweep of course is one that wasn’t recognized but after letting them know the status of our lease negotiations that will change. However there is a written comment period now underway and all comments are due by March 17. Your Recreational Airport Committee will be drafting a comment from the APA and will also provide a letter of comment in a template for each of you to use in your own comments to the BLM.</p>



<p>There will be a large push for this in February and the only way we will preserve some of these back country jewels is to come at them with a large number of comments.</p>



<p>Please contact me via email if you would like to be listed as one interested in saving these strips and are willing to send in your comments.</p>



<p>Thank you in advance </p>



<p>Mark Hawkins</p>



<p>Recreational Airport Committee</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“Where have all the airstrips gone?” Do pilots want to sing this song far into the future?</p>



<p>General aviation airstrips in the United States are disappearing at a rate of 2 per week. Some are well publicized, such as Meigs Field in Chicago. Others receive little or no publicity including many unpaved airstrips in rural and mountainous backcountry.</p>



<p>The Pretty Prairie airstrip in the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana has been closed since 1964. The RAF will help prevent any similar closures in the future.</p>



<p>Usually these unpaved airstrips are on public lands administered by the United States Forest Service (USFS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), or other federal and state government agencies. Their disappearance is often the result of revised planning documents that fail to recognize or address the needs of general aviation because pilots are not involved in the process.</p>



<p>In 1998, the Montana Pilots’ Association (MPA) became concerned with the loss of recreational and backcountry airstrips and formed the Recreational Airstrip Committee (RAC) to take an active part in the planning process.</p>



<p>The RAC has made considerable progress, but it soon became obvious additional funding was required to maintain and create airstrips. The Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF) was incorporated in Montana on December 22, 2003, filed a 501(c) (3) application with the Internal Revenue Service for non-profit, tax-exempt, public charity status effective December 30, 2003, and received recognition of that status on July 7, 2004.</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>The RAF will use tax-deductible donations to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Provide more participation with governmental agencies controlling rural and backcountry airstrips to preserve and protect public access.</li>
<li>Improve and maintain existing rural and backcountry airstrips.</li>
<li>Acquire or lease land to construct additional general aviation airstrips.</li>
<li>Educate the public on the benefits of rural and backcountry airstrips.</li>
<li>Promote Air Safety through support of flight training seminars.</li>
</ul>



<p>
</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>The RAF is not a Montana-only organization. It was established by Montana pilots but is concerned with preserving backcountry airstrips throughout the west through the lending of expertise, experience, reference documents and financial help when applicable. The RAF board members have gained a wealth of experience in working with federal and state agencies who manage public lands where airstrips are located as well as dealing with groups who oppose the existence of backcountry airstrips.</p>
